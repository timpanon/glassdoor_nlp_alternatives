1,Microsoft,Thoughts after 10 years....,2013-01-28,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"1.  If you love tech, this is a great place.  No doubt you'll talk tech (mostly the MSFT stack) from enterprise to consumer - from PCs to phones to Xboxes - from datacenter to desktop.

2.  What were GREAT benefits are now VERY GOOD (took a small step down) but still probably better than you'll find at 99% of large corporations.  If you've got family - the value of the benefits is even higher.  401k match is nice.

3.  Even with it's struggles MSFT is still a cash printing machine.  This means if you can keep your nose clean and do reasonable work, you can have a stable job, pay your bills, feed your family, and not worry (too much) about layoffs.  The stock you own likely won't tank, but probably won't go up much either.  You'll get a bonus each year and some stock.  It's a decent life if you aren't looking to light the world on fire.","Brand on Your Resume:  After many years of losing market share and struggling to be at the front end of innovation and the fact that there's 90,000 employees, don't think MSFT is necessarily going to be attractive on your resume to more agile and smaller companies.

Managing Your Career:  Make you say this out loud so it registers - 90,000 employees work there.  Double that for vendors.  It is VERY hard to ""stand out"" and move up in the company.  Don't expect your manager to be much of an advocate or enabler to help you meet your career goals - they are basically trying to survive the stack rank every year too.  Not familiar with the stack rank?  Check out the 2012 Vanity Fair article called ""Microsoft's Lost Decade""."
2,Microsoft,Never drank a company's kool-aid until Microsoft. They get it.,2022-03-30,5.0,Content Program Manager,"Whether they genuinely care about their employees as humans or not, they at least do a darn good job of acting like they do. Microsoft is a rare company that understands ""if you take care of your employees, they will take care of your company.""

- I dare you to find a better 401k match. 50% on any contribution amount, up to the government's limit. AND it vests immediately. It's yours from day one. Literally $10,250 of free money on top of normal compensation.

- Healthcare is great. Tier 1 in the US for sure. Maybe there's a couple companies out there with better coverage. But Microsoft doesn't charge you for it. Literally zero dollars out of the employee's paycheck. There's a fee to add a spouse or domestic partner denying their own company's coverage, but that's fair. Also no added cost for dependents. That's amazing.

Parental leave. They match the WA State policy of 12 weeks (+ more for birth mothers). It's super easy to take advantage of, and it's available Day 1 of employment. It's unfortunate that this benefit feels ""special"" in the US, but I'm thankful for it.

- Base is competitive. But actually competitive. Not how bs companies say it as a way to compete with you for the lowest pay possible. They get it. They need and want to get quality people, and keep them at Microsoft.

- Any negative culture stigmas from a couple decades ago are gone. The culture now is relentlessly supportive and accommodating. Work life balance is preached. We're all adults here, trusting other adults to do their job, regardless of what hours they need to do it.

- Signing bonus + stock bonus + annual bonus. Work hard, get more. Beautiful.

I've historically cringed at people who spewed love for their company on Glassdoor. It always screamed ""I'm and HR drone posting fake reviews to cover up all the bad ones."" But here I am. Not an HR drone, a real human grateful to be in the Microsoft bubble. Believe it or not.","Let's be real. No company is perfect. Work is work. But for sake of not being ""everything is perfect,""

- It's a huge company. The endless abyss of information, acronyms, jargon, etc can be obnoxious. Onboarding can be comical. Where do I find xyz? What's actually important? What version of comparable documents is the ""right"" one? But that's easily combatted by asking someone who knows.

- Huge company means lots of ""hurry up and wait."" Let's be honest, that's frustrating. You're bound to encounter differing opinions and such. ""Looks good, but ope, now there's feedback from another group, and now we need approval from xyz. Glad I stressed about this yesterday when it turns out it's gonna sit for another week."

People spend years at MS being under-leveled with no path to promotion, and completely subjective decisions because managers are overpowered in this department and actual impact has no effect on their decisions - it's a popularity contest, so if you're not you managers favorite, you're never getting promoted. It's relatively easy to move around to try and correct that but it can also set you back YEARS because your new team doesn't really care about the blood you spilled on the last product.

Managers are just the best IC in the room and have zero actual management skills along with training that just requires them to FF a video and show no proof of competency. This is the biggest issue with Microsoft, they don't hire people that are good managers to be managers - being the best programmer or designer has NOTHING to do with being a good manager and they simply don't get that."

No wondering where the company's revenue is coming from and how your product fits into that -- even if that means you're explicitly working on ""table stakes"" features or free services that add value for the customers. The company cares about social issues, environmental issues, etc. Microsoft is regarded as one of the ""least evil"" big tech companies to work for, but you ""pay"" for that by taking a lower salary. Great benefits, but on par with other ""big-tech"" / ""FAANG"" companies. Generally values work-life balance.","The expectations can be high and maintaining excellent quality of services at the limit of the team's scope isn't enough to get promoted, even if there's no work on your team to grab to grow your career and secure a promotion. This means you should always be looking at how your career can grow and whether to seek another team at some point if promotions get to be hard to come by. Company culture doesn't necessarily work its way into all teams from the top down. Middle management not encouraging the ideal workplace culture can make it difficult to bring it from the bottom up, but many employees and managers close to the products care enough to overcome that hurdle at times. When you work on a product that's a free service not specifically tied to a revenue stream, budgets are tight. If you want a quick path to promotion find a team with broad customer scope where the line between customer revenue earned and the code you wrote is easy to draw. Other arguably equivalent ""value adds"" to the company's brands and services that don't directly drive profit are harder to sell your performance. Work-life balance may suffer if you're on-call, depending on the team."

People are quick to judge you based on your looks and attitude. I'm not sure how/why it's bred this culture but they're not as ""inclusive"" as they seem. They breed an incredibly competitive culture where it's the norm to be incredibly selfish and highly judgemental of everyone and their work (they call it ""being critical"" and ""defining impact"").

737,Microsoft,Amazing place to work with a considerably good culture.,2022-01-09,5.0,Senior Software Engineering Lead,"There are many reasons to work at Microsoft , though I'd highlight two that stood out for me:

Microsoft's culture is strongly philanthropic. This characteristic, set foremost by Bill Gates, has continued to imbue the culture of the entire company, down to individual employees. Its annual Giving Campaign elicits participation from nearly all employees. At Microsoft, it's quite common to support coworkers towards their charitable causes, and to talk about charitable giving regularly. I thought that was common to all companies, but it's not -- it's actually relatively rare to have a company culture that has philanthropy so close to its core.
There are a lot of choices for what to work on. Server to client, consumer to enterprise, software to firmware to hardware -- there's just a boatload of choice to switch around in the company. Though I always stayed on the software side, I managed to work in Office, MSN, Windows, Tablet PC, and Bing Search during a span of 12 years.
Seattle, despite what detractors say, is, in my opinion, an amazing city to live in, especially if you have (or plan to have) a family. It's very progressive, huge on the outdoors, has amazing summers, and also has the nation's highest percentage of college grads, which makes for interesting conversation wherever you go.","I'm sure it used to be good place, but I've found so many examples of really bad management, lack of (real) commitment to work/products/customers. I haven't seen a good example of teamwork in years, also nobody cares about ""code quality"", technical expertise, and all that matters in building great software. Most Principal and Seniors I've seen are mostly consumed by the politics created by their managers or upper management and worried about their own performance reviews rather than taking responsibility of product, people or customers they are getting paid from. Every year I've seen two things constantly on my reviews ""Technical awesomeness"", ""Improve on communication"" (from multiple managers). Actually I think I'm just an average developer and I've seen (technically) awesome people elsewhere. Hardest thing in Microsoft is switching between teams, if you're not well connected."

- Nice people across the company
- Linear growth is easy to predict and work towards
- Chance to work on a team whose product/service impacts millions","- Linear growth stagnates high-potential employees to grow the same pace as less ambitious colleagues
- Way too many PMs and not enough Engineers, this leads to multiple verticals introduced in the same product but no consistency or connection between these verticals
- Prioritization of tasks is a joke. There could be an issue impacting 1M+ users but they'll put priority on fixing an issue/creating a feature that the PMs or leadership team want to pivot towards because they think it will have impact (it literally never does). They don't use user studies correctly or even acknowledge customer feedback which leads to important customer requested features to be in massive backlogs. 
- Engineering quality isn't impressive at all and is easily noticeable in product performance, product bugs, service outages and even internal tools
- Engineering teams are underfunded so there is always work to do and not enough time, which leads to scope creep and delays in shipping feature/bug fixes
- Build systems are a constant work in progress and policies are continually being added, which brings down development velocity
- Hiring bar has definitely dropped and some of the new grad hires are questionable
- Pay is less than the industry standard and engineering is underfunded. So it makes a lot of sense when they report earnings every quarter because they're understaffed on the engineering front and still underpaying engineers"

1028,Microsoft,"Under pays, horrible benefits, terrible culture",2022-01-01,1.0,Sales Specialist,Not much I can think of,"Dumbest thing I’ve done is buying into the hype and joining Microsoft. First off, they pay horribly, far below average for sales. They are so incredibly cheap that they expect the public markets to pay you. I’m financing one of the richest companies on the planet from savings from their terrible pay. The sales targets are pulled from their imaginations , they have absolutely no connection to reality. Every sales person will whine about goals but I’ve never seen quotas in the hundreds of millions for an individual contributor. Hell would have to freeze over 2x to make these quotas. The benefits are terrible, in fact beyond terrible. I’ve never paid so much out of pocket as Microsoft Yes, you don’t have to contribute to your benefits but they cover absolutely nothing. Having to switch all my doctors and even if I switch the lab bills are burying me because none of the labs are in network. Everyone is so busy that it’s impossible to spend time with peers for more than 30 minutes. Everyone is super young and largely unqualified for their roles outside of selling teams or office. Security sales teams are an absolute joke and it’s no wonder they are getting crushed by all security competition, even w decent products. Corporate leaders hide behind massive squads of underpaid, inexperienced program managers who have no real work experience. It’s truly the worst company I’ve worked for. What tops it off is that anyone there over 5 years has made a ton in the stock market and they could care less about the day to day. Stay away!!!"

Satya promotes a good overall direction.","Work-life balance can be rough if you're a software engineer in certain orgs. Most engineers I met were forced into participating in on-call support rotations. When you're on-call, be prepared to skip most travel or any event where you can't reach a laptop to be online to respond within 10 minutes. 

We were told by management that, in order to meet our requirements, we should avoid going to movies, sporting events, and to avoid areas where cell service wasn't consistent, and anywhere that we couldn't get internet service quickly. Be ready to skip workout classes, school events, long walks, or even scenarios where you may potentially get stuck in traffic. 

These on-call shifts may last for a few hours/day up to an entire week at a time depending on your team's rotation policy. There is no real compensation for work done during on-call shifts or for being on call. Your manager may give you some flexibility in your working hours to compensate.

Some upper managers are really into doublespeak and cognitive dissonance. When multiple teams were laid off to move headcount to sites in other countries (without reasoning given), the VP of the org bragged of record growth and profits while simultaneously telling everyone that they need to tighten up and work harder because they were now inexplicably short-staffed."

A lot of the ongoing daily activities are made up on the spot which normally does not set you up for success and becomes very frustrating when discussing key performance metrics down the line.
1061,Microsoft,Great company with horrible HR department,2021-11-30,4.0,Solutions Architect,Microsoft (outside of HR) has great ethics. They action the words most other companies publicize for clout. I got to have impact on some of the most interesting new features happening in the world today. The benefits are outstanding. The community of my peers is second to none.,"Two things that are both HR policies. 

1. You are NOT ALLOWED to interview for a job that is above your level. This is tied to the second item list below but is probably the most damning thing about Microsoft. If you are a level 60 (random) and you would like to interview for a great job posted at level 61. Your ability, experience, resume, position or any other work-related attribute doesn't matter. You will be told that you are not able to loop (interview) for the job. The only exceptions are executive level bypass when is nearly unheard of. This policy suppresses career growth and is compounded by the second point below. 

2. Microsoft has a policy that when you are promoted you don't get a level or pay increase. They treat job titles and job levels differently. If you become a Senior in your field with all the extra work that entails you will not be given any extra pay or bonus or anything. That is because of a HR policy that FORBIDS increasing a person's level (which is your pay) with their job title (which is what you do). Level increase are very difficult to obtain. Hence the reason so many people boomerang. Boomeranging is when you leave Microsoft for a couple of years and come back at the level and job you originally wanted and were qualified for. Everyone at Microsoft is well aware of this problem and is powerless to influence HR into any different action. This leads to many high-quality employees leaving the company. We have been calling it the ""Brain-Drain"". When HR is asked about why they have such a bad policy they give a standard answer of (We want our employees to do a job not for the money but for the job itself). That is not true. They are suppressing employee wage increases that should be commensurate with title and work increases. If you are looking to accept a job at Microsoft. Ask what level the job is. Ask what level it could be. Get the highest level possible."

- MSR (Microsoft Research)","Microsoft is already a great company (definitely one of the top 5 in the world IMHO), I had a great experience there and I am very thankful for my years at Microsoft. I learned a lot, and I am hoping to come back to Microsoft again at some point in my career. However, I believe these are the things that can be improved:

- Speed: older orgs are reluctant to change
- Benefits fall behind top competitions (Google, FB)
- Office Politics (in some but definitely not all teams and orgs)
- Unlike companies like FB and Amazon that are willing to take some risks and trust younger employees based on their performance and capabilities for management and leadership roles, at Microsoft (at least some older orgs) certain jobs are always indefinitely ""reserved"" for employees with +20 years of experience, even when they don't have relevant experiences or expertise.
- Too many PMs wrt the number of Eng and DS/AS ICs, which has shifted (too much) the atmosphere of the company from an Eng to PM company
- Many free-riders! :)"

Retaliated and bullied by manager for raising a D&I issue despite strong evidence. HR didn’t act to rectify either.

1375,Microsoft,Dream Company (ideals); Nightmare Company (people),2021-10-29,2.0,Marketing Manager,"Microsoft's ideals and philosophy are some of the best in the tech space.

The Consumer team is really great to work with and learn and grow from.

It was fun to be under a large company that other companies wanted to work with. 

The head of GM is incredibly smart and someone I enjoyed talking to and learning under on the media side. 

The Director of Commercial was also a very personable and sharp person in the programmatic space, albeit a little aloof to what was happening on their large team. If the original team I was on was dissolved and I worked under him (or the Director of Consumer) I am sure I would still be at Microsoft today.","The worklife balance is nonexistent. You are told you should have the ability to work how you want, but the work never slows down and you'll never advance if you don't continuously take on new projects to ""prove your worth"".

I was also essentially bullied for 2+ years with HR doing nothing about it. Cases created, tried to talk to management and the individuals themselves. Much of it went under the rug or ignored or told ""oh yeah we will correct this"". Eventually I was told that it was a ""me problem"", which didn't help anything. The fact that a manager can give you low marks in the annual review and take THOUSANDS of dollars out of your pocket based on demonstrably false information is a real miss in the performance review process. HR also had no recourse for contesting the claims vs a hidden word document that you hoped a future boss would check (or even know to check).

A small weird one, but I was told that I didn't have ""relevant experience"" for a position even though I came in with 8 year's previous. It was the fact that I didn't have ""experience at Microsoft"" was the decider. That seems unreasonable given the work is the same (if not easier) inside the company vs what was done previously.

Also how do you have a middle manager who openly proclaims how much they dislike women because of their ""moodiness and emotional baggage""? Then another manager who openly discusses trying to fire someone on their team?"

1477,Microsoft,"Good fit for engineers who aren't very technical, wasted time for others",2021-10-04,3.0,Software Engineer,"- No dress code for most
- Can work almost whenever/wherever you want depending on the team, during these virtual/hybrid-model times.
- Lots of ergonomic setups in the office (ie adjust desk height, adjustable chairs, great keyboard, not so great mouse)
- Good pay, not FAANG but better than your average company
- Depending on team and level, many have good work-life balance and often can get away with < 40 hours per week.
- Bright offices and great drinks/sodas in the fridge, coffee, tea etc.
- Some neat offices and decorations ie Xbox game characters, tree houses which are used as meeting rooms.
- Good benefits + PTO.
- Great transit in the area ie Red Line in Redmond/Overlake/Bellevue.
- Pretty area in Redmond/Overlake, lots of trees and view of the Cascades.
- Time tracking is probably not strict for your team/manager.
- Get to see a LOT of Microsoft code you may be curious about.
- Diversity and Inclusion is surprisingly good in some ways (especially LGBTQIA+, and I suspect my team had a furry), except there are still jerks, they just use different language...","- Very corporate. Lots of people are focused on building their careers (just look at their LinkedIn profiles) and looking good for promotions, not so much helping you out or being thorough in their work. The company has its own language and acronyms which people use to ""fit in"" and look better for promos. In reality I think people get into Microsoft and then are afraid of leaving since other companies might not want ex-Microsoft/old people. I think MS probably doesn't have the ageism bias that other tech co's have, though.
- Lateral internal movement only, no promotions going from one team to another.
- Cult-like focus on managers. These people tend to have the power to do basically anything to your career, good or bad. Higher-up managers are often completely disconnected from their teams and don't have anything constructive to add.
- SLOW career growth. Takes many years to level up from SWE1 to Senior/etc. Even if you work hard, management will only want to promote you every 1 year at most, and each band SWE1/2/Senior/etc has multiple levels. You get 1 promo level at a time. You'd level up way faster by switching companies entirely. In my case I left Microsoft and got 2 promotions by joining another high-profile tech company in the Seattle area.
- Most engineers don't want to learn new things or experiment. I think they think there's a lot more risk than reward in testing new things. They also are not very knowledgeable about the platform they run on (Azure) which is shocking.
- Oncall is painful since no one wants to improve their service or learn.
- Have to use MS technologies, which could be fun for some, I personally dislike them.
- Lots of people hate Microsoft's products, and you might have to work on those products.
- Lots of jerks/people with a lack of empathy work at Microsoft, even the new culture training hasn't helped them. I quit MS due to a boss that regularly lashed out at his employees and gaslighted us.
- Not many great technical challenges (except maybe Azure, which many MS engineers have aired complaints about anyway) so very technical engineers might be happier at i.e. Google or Uber. Technical accomplishments might not be rewarded or appreciated as much here as other companies."

● Colleagues/Peers great 
● Management some are great but most OK.
● Training, more than you can handle
● Salary, competitive with market","After 23 years of service, employees might have loyalty towards the company but that loyalty is reciprocal. Managements says they're being transparent, but they easily caught in a web of tangled lies when employees talk to their peers.

When employees start talking to each other comparing notes, they quickly realize they're given more than an unfair workload to deal with and get stressed out. Someone with a conspiracists mind would say ""it is a great way to get rid of the older employees by assigning them contracts totaling 5300 hours which is stupid or 3800 is not much better. Because on top of handling that workload, you also have to attend a lot of meeting, trainings, study for certifications, you have to be diverse and attend different ERG activities, and the list goes on... Partner accounts for the business are great, but dealing with the abuse of these Partner accounts needs to been stopped before all CSAMs get burned out and begin leaving. Because that is what drove me to early retirement. Life at Microsoft is very stressful, just like it is at Google, Amazon AWS, or any large corporation. 

Companies like Microsoft love hiring college graduates, because they pay them below fair market since they have no experience, give them months of training, and they're hungry full of energy to absorb like a sponge, and are willing to work 48-52 hours or more to climb the company ladder. What these college graduates and Microsoft don't realize, is the BURNOUT is a REAL epidemic happening in a lot of industries,"

Microsoft culture abuses new employees' lack of knowledge about corporate culture.

The culture lacks a modicum of adult self-awareness and doesn't realize that it's internal culture is a lot more like a high-school clique than, say, IBM, or Google.

Toxic-male misogyny is normalized and female managers are groomed to emulate the worst behaviors of the male managers.

Women in management attack and sabotage their female subordinates.

Customers are treated with dismissive arrogance, as employees are.

Teams composed of all technically skilled ethic minorities led by skill-less white people is common.

Managers are empowered and do ignore employee requests for accommodations for mental illness requiring a ""doctor's note"" for mental illness accommodations. There is no focus on balancing life with work."

This is because the Product Managers I was working with were working on the same product for 15 years. They believe that ML is just a bunch of buzz words with no potential to help the business.

The managers do not like to be challenged to explore news ways of looking at their products' data to find out and fix loopholes. They rely on their domain understanding and make decision based on their ""gut feeling"" instead of being data driven.

They need to adapt to machine learning thinking by gathering alternate data on their products, form hypotheses, come up with solutions to test them to improve their business rather than use ML at Hackathons just to demonstrate that they hire people who know ML."

Being virtual made asking for help hard. It's easier to drop by your workmate's office and show them why your code isn't working as opposed to having them drop everything and hop on a teams call.

Doing my internship virtually also made all the events a little subpar. I definitely would have preferred watching Sofia Rodriguez live as opposed to over a live stream. Just didn't hit the same. Felt like youtube tbh.

Not a lot of training on the best coding practices, or Microsoft's secret sauce. I basically YouTubed everything I needed to learn to get the job done. I had expected a little more structure from a program for people with little to no prior experience."

- active employee community, but only for FTEs
- CFO
- Accessibility
- Due to employee pressure, it is trending towards Diversity and Inclusion, but still has a long way to go.","- Front line employees are underpaid compared to leadership. 
- The salaries and bonuses of employees through principal band are the first to take a hit on a less successful year (or even if leadership is worried about the future), and senior management reaps the rewards on good years with the only trickle down being maintaining just below market rate salaries.
- They consistently pay slightly less than their main competitors, because they sell their culture and benefits as worth more.
- Non-FTEs and often those outside Redmond headquarters are treated like second class citizens
- Not equitable: Promote based on reputation more than accomplishments
- Chief Legal Officer"

I've worked at Microsoft for the majority of my professional career in several different PM roles (technical and non-technical) across a few teams. By and large I've been treated well, had wonderful colleagues, and benefited greatly from the opportunities available to me. Who your manager is matters a lot.

- Some cool projects to work on.
- You get to work on products that are used globally.
- Decent healthcare.
- Stock price is decent right now.","- They believe that raising leads and managers from the ranks will always work. The result is managers and leads who don't know how to manage a diverse set of employees and instead simply look to forward their career. Managers can be caustic and will happily play favorites.
- Pay is below comparable companies
- Work life balance is given lip service but never actually improved.
- While working remote, people are often impossible to get a hold of unless you nag nag nag. Your management will yell at you for not being creative enough about how you nag people if you tell your management you're blocked by someone else.
- Be ready to be combative with management. They won't always help you, argue for you or be understanding. Some leads will be good, many will not."

2018,Microsoft,I don't know about you but this place is exhausting,2021-07-21,3.0,Content Developer/Writer,"Excellent medical coverage benefits!
Good benefits overall when compared with most other companies. Most people do not take a look at the depth of benefits that MSFT provides or take advantage of all of them (1200/year for wellness/hobbies, discounted eyeglasses at their internal eye doctor place, you get deep prescription drug discounts if filling at their pharmacy for example). Awesome other perks like use of the maker space, free yoga and wellness programs, even relationship or nutrition coaching.
Opportunity to learn a ton in a short amount of time - 1 year at MSFT is equivalent to many more years at a mid-size business. You'll have access to a lot of learning resources online, through their library, etc - it's as much learning as you can cram into your brain although there may not be enough time in the day to prioritize it. 
Most people are very smart and talented, tends to be a very driven, results-oriented team of people which can be fun and motivated
Excellent work life balance on my particular team but can vary depending on your team (Azure is not great at it for example) 
Compensation is not the highest in the industry but it is in the top 5, stock is on the up and up so financially the last year or so has been really advantageous.","The main takeaway here is that this place is really stressful. Expect to grow some gray hair and also get good at managing your own stress. 
In my organization planning takes 8 weeks of a 16 week quarter which is totally ridiculous.
If someone leaves the team, their work is just reallocated to everyone who is still there, backfills during the pandemic have been rare in my organization. This has led to a lot of people being frustrated and burnt out. 
The sexism and racism is still real despite major efforts on the D&I front. Too many people who don't get it are in major leadership roles. Making actual progress on D&I issues can be insanely slow due to organizational size and lack of will. Senior Leadership Team (Satya etc) have a vision and want the right things, middle layers of management either don't care or might want to care but are so busy it's the last thing to ever get done. 
Review/Connect system has undergone changes and is supposed to be casual but isn't, ways to advance at the company are very murky. The old ""make alliances with the cool kids and promote yourself by sending status mails about your projects to look promotable"" is the best strategy to get ahead and that is unfortunate as it means a lot of the people in management are good at either manipulating people or ass-kissing but not actually good managers or good at their jobs. It is less ""stab people in the back to get ahead"" than it was but paths for advancement can be limited and confusing. 
Retention numbers of minorities, which they do not often publicize, are low.
Every person who was the best at their job on my team has left for Google or Facebook or to start their own company. Not sure MSFT is retaining best-in-industry talent (possibly because comp is better at other companies). 
Priority in my particular team is to make ""good enough"" solutions rather than great solutions. It can be frustrating to work with a lot of people who just want to keep their heads down and do whatever is easiest rather than what will end up being right for customers or right for long-term product development. Long term planning ability at MSFT is limited because changes are so frequent to organizations. 
Onboarding is non-existent, MSFT is a sink or swim environment. You might get an outdated OneNote with some notes from someone but I would not expect more than that as someone joining!
Amount of time spent fighting fires is more than spent on regular job tasks. There can be interdepartmental sparring for resources, attention, because two incapable dudes who somehow became managers feel like it, etc. which can be frustrating."

Many of the people that I work with are amazing! Especially on the CSAM team.

Diversity and inclusion is a priority at Microsoft, and I feel it at a corporate level (although not necessarily within my organization- leadership in GAMD).","Unfortunately, the list of cons is quite extensive. On the team that I am on, work life balance is non-existent. 

Pay is below market average, and incredibly low compared to other roles within Microsoft.

Our tools are terrible. Most of our tools are designed in-house, and  often don’t work.

Partners and customers are terrible! I’ve seen a trend the last few years that our customers and partners are becoming more aggressive and disrespectful. It is making it challenging to work with some of them.

Support can be challenging, and the customers and partners will let you know it.

The biggest challenge is when someone leaves the team, their responsibilities get divided out to the remaining team members. We have some teams that have been down almost a third of their staff- which means the rest of the team is responsible for picking up the slack."

* Most teams have a collaborative environment
* The new Microsoft under Satya's leadership is really awesome!
* New Performance Management system does not force managers to label employees with a rating, or meet a bell curve/forced distribution as a result managers are motivated to keep people discussions very positive and healthy, and not a blood bath like it was several years ago.","* Some teams are very fast paced (Azure) and can be overwhelming. Work Life Balance has a potential to go out the window so you have to own/manage it.
* Promotions are hard to come by at Principal/Partner levels.
* Newer employees make more $$ than those who have stayed for long (which I believe is true everywhere). Employees who do not want to lose their edge on earning potential may be tempted to leave the company to other FAANG/Tech companies and come back (boomerang) at higher levels/compensation in a few years, which is quite common."

No cohesive strategy or leadership, things go in circles based on who is in power in your organization for a whopping 9 to 18 months, you can kick butt in your performance and you will still only get slightly higher than average rewards, promotions to the higher levels are entirely politically based, 9 times out of 10 they hire in higher levels instead of promoting from within, they spend millions on consultants to come in and recommend what you've already been advocating for months, teams spend a lot of time (corporate) virtue signaling but if you step back and look at their actions you see they don't actually live it."

+ Really took care of employees during COVID-19 - for example, Cafe staff were still paid as though they were working full time even though the campus was closed
+ Awesome mission, and probably the most mature culture 
+ Relatively high concentration of talent - you can easily find role models 
+ Work has humongous impact that generally improves productivity, empowers people and organizations, and improve lives.. and because the company does so much open source or uses so much open source, a lot of the work you do has high visibility. I mean imagine being a VS Code engineer...
+ Culture
+ The company takes work life balance and running enduring, sustainable teams very seriously.","- It is a huge company so there will be some teams that are not as well run, and some teams where there's unfortunately a higher than normal concentration of ""old mindset"" people 
- Microsoft does not pay the best out there. If you're optimizing for direct compensation, this might not be the place for you. Instead, it generally looks at the overall ""deal"".
- It's a great place to ""grow up"" and build a career, but being loyal generally also means that not only are you not super well paid to begin with, the rate that your compensation adjusts naturally also does not keep to pace if you were to jump between companies."

3473,Microsoft,"Was good in Stores, now they don't care.",2021-03-01,2.0,SERVICE ADVISOR,"When they operated in Stores, it felt good, we had plenty of unique opportunity in our roles and capabilities, and could explore other areas of interest if we wanted. We were given guidelines but allowed to operate creatively and change things up to better fit our needs and our customer's needs. We could strive and grow in our areas, and participate in other areas as we wanted to and could while still helping our customers.","Over the last year, they've forced thousands of retail employees to change careers, some not by much and many by a LOT (i.e from Gaming Experts and Service Advisors into Glorified Telemarketer Business Sales). Senior leadership is completely tone deaf, they no longer care about their public perception, their employees, or whether we're happy or not and tell us ""you should be grateful you still have a job"" and ""if you don't like it, you can leave"" and that somehow we're just as privileged as a VP making 6 figures. There's so little focus on career growth outside of sales, it's incredible, but they keep touting ""oh well you can continue to develop in this space and search for those opportunities"". The culture of ""greater Microsoft"" which is what they call corporate, is incredibly downward looking at anybody in the other parts of the organization. Over half of the retail employees have left for one reason or another, primarily from their careers being obliterated and shoved to the side and our management and leadership not even bothering to try and pretend like they care anymore, and I don't blame them whatsoever."
3474,Microsoft,"Slow movement, massive rewards",2021-02-22,4.0,Customer Success Manager,"Pay and compensation regularly above market. Remote work has been always available, and a giant organization gives employees the opportunity to explore all kinds of interests and resources. Culture of inclusion pivoting to hire from ""non-traditional"" backgrounds is beginning to build an interesting and diverse workforce. Strong Senior Leadership. Great benefits, tuition reimbursement especially. Skilling focus, self-managed growth and learning opportunities, and the name recognition that can be quite impressive to external hiring.","Benefits standard for tech, but on the lower rungs (retail, employees sub. <60,000) the co-pays can be impactful. Difficult to time tuition reimbursements to ""real"" college semesters, best to apply yearly instead.

Management in direct teams are under so much pressure to perform that they can in turn overwhelm or give conflicting information on a day-to-day basis. Low retail-to-corporate transition pipeline exacerbated by shuttering of retail stores in favor of hub model. Poor communication when internal hires are concerned. 

Rarely hear back from hiring managers or recruitment agents unless you are being hired. No feedback on interviews that do not result in a hire. Promises for temporary roles to become permanent that never materialize and return now over-skilled employees to lower rungs, making even moving forward in another organization difficult.

Quarterly team rotations leave customers with few resources that they know directly, and employees are often placed on a merry-go-round of ""find new person in charge."""

3485,Microsoft,Fully understand the compensation plans before accepting,2021-02-23,3.0,Solutions Architect,The support for people with disabilities.,"Employees don't share in the success of the company. They use equity awards to link your compensation to the company success. But - the problem ids, those awards are given out based on subjective personal performance criteria, measured against other employees in an organization. It is particularly bad for the CSAs and GBB where the bulk of your variable comp is this thing called ""CBI"", which has nothing to do with the success of the company. It has everything to do with ""managing your brand"" and networking up. So - even if Azure is killing it - 150% of plan, if you don't ""measure up"" with your ""Impact"", you may still not even get your OTE. Some people might like this, it does have one plus, you have total control over it, or at least your own performance relative to what are subjective and unknowable criteria. If you like being a thoroughbred racehorse in the stable and running flat out races against the other horses in the stable, GBB/CSA might be for you. If you like being a contributing member of a high preforming team, probably not."

Team dependant.. but management has a tendency to ignore large technical problems.. or under estimate complexity of projects leading to false starts and resets where we have to dig out of the hole we find ourselves in. Commonly, a virtual team prototypes with no domain knowledge, ships it, gets rewards, and hands off maintenance to the experts to fix.

No/very less bureaucracy - Directors/Partners will often chat with you and help you resolve technical stuff. Most of the Senior Management is technically Sound.","Very poor rewards compared to similar roles in the industry. for ex: for Principal role competitors pay over 80%.

Many teams in Azure are stuck in REPETITIVE work like migrating from PAAS V1 infrastructure to the PAAS V2 infra, rotating Certificates etc. Very unproductive. Several quarters - teams would not deliver an ounce of actual Service features - but, just the technical debt. Leadership, higher up - lacked vision & failed to align this well back in 2012 - azure inception times and existing new developers are taking a hit because of that.

Poor tech Vision, atleast in Azure. 

Satya Nadella, the great visionary and exceptional leader - tells a lot of cool stuff - but the middle management doesn't seem to give a damn. Most of them have no idea what he is telling. They don't get time to follow him :). For ex: no/very few managers follows growth mindset or Leadership principles or hiring-in as an interviewing philosophy. They are good people. Just that, they are so worked up - that there won't be any time left to listen to these.

Most of the Teams across the company are moving to Services model. You will end up working 24/7; no family nights; no weekends - if you know stuff :).

Rewards and Compensation model - almost incentivizes people to not share information and work in isolation. This has a huge negative impact on the Culture. Culture in many teams is close to Toxic. 

Large delay between MS Polls. Or in general - data about how things are going or employee experience - is collected like - once in an Year! By the time the data is collected - most of the times - the problems faced become irrelevant.

Movement inside the company is not easy. Especially, Principal engineers have extra diversity based rules - which reduces the available options from an already reduced set."

Workplace investigation won't help they are only there to minimize the legal risk to thr company.

- Wonderful connector buses to take you from meeting to meeting
- Projects are interesting, work is rewarding when we ship 
- We build on our own cloud services, which is really a nice differentiator 
- Redmond area is beautiful, and there are paths around campus that go through woody areas for a run during lunch break
- Benefits are fantastic","- it takes at least a year to ""get Microsoft"". If you're a senior member joining from the outside, don't expect to make waves your first few months. Microsoft is very relationship based, and to build relationships takes time.
- Politics. It's everywhere and you can't avoid it. There's a lot of people waiting for their moment to shine, and will take credit any opportunity that they can for others work, just to justify their involvement.
- Too many meetings. It's actually a bit out of control. For every executive meeting, expect at least 4 prep meetings to get to that meeting.
- Diversity is also a con. Most senior tech leaders are men. The way of doing work is very aggressive, so the women that do make it that far are usually not very likeable.
- Re-orgs are constantly happening. In one year I had 6 managers. I get it, we have to change org structures constantly to keep up with market demands. But 6? really?

Good leadership, career progression, and clear HR processes.","Microsoft's a fantastic place to work if you're raising a family or have been in the industry for a while, and it definitely shows. When HQ is in the suburbs and the workforce is older compared to the rest of big tech, the culture is less ""Silicon Valley"" and more ""comfy employer to work for the rest of your life"".

As much as Microsoft tries to position itself as working on ""sexy"" technology, the core business is B2B business systems, and unless you happen to be working on select teams like Xbox/Hololens/Azure, you'll most likely be working on technology that's been around for a long time and processes that are resistant to change. These systems are profitable & successful, without a doubt, but they're hard to get excited about on a daily basis."

4. Most of time, product features /roadmap are simply copy of primary competitor in the respective domain. This is easy and you can see it even if you are an outsider. 
3. Top-down, hierarchical management style. You need to kowtow to your boss to get good performance review and bonus and stock reward.

- MSFT stock has been killing it
- Great products to be proud of
- General trend and direction of MSFT overall has been good
- Rewarding and fun experience, provided you have a good manager","- Compensation is not competitive unless you get bonuses. They will make up reasons not to give you good bonuses, despite going above and beyond and  delivering beyond expectations
- Your enjoyment at Microsoft depends entirely on your manager and skip-level manager
- Microsoft is driven from the top-down culture, nothing bubbles up unless your managers do it for you (and they're too scared to disagree with VPs)
- ""Yes"" culture and lying in Azure. Facades and half baked solutions because everything is rushed to simply get the MVP to answer ""yes"". You will find your managers and developers lying ALL the time to look better on the surface.
- Nepotism & bro culture - They pretend that they are fixing this issue but you will still find a significant amount of teams that only hire the same race and gender (generally men). These teams have been around for over 5 years and they have no interest in changing that dynamic.
- Odd situations where female leadership will promote only women, regardless of the actual work they're doing and merit.
- No actual career growth as a 10xer. It's completely made up and they will still fit you into a box designed by HR.
- Random VPs and principals getting promotions or laid-off mid-year out of the blue. No justification or input from us below, just behind the scene handshake deals between nepotists. You're at the mercy of these re-orgs as attitudes shift and people up above start revealing their true colors.
- Toxic unproductive employees or managers exist and are ignored and unchecked. Don't waste your time with HR unless you plan on lawyering up yourself.
- For both internal and external products that have terrible infrastructure, its always due to poor management chains and lack of feedback loops."

They give you a health savings account and reimburse you for fitness stuff yearly","They have slowly moved away from being for their employees. They took lunches and made them shorter, much shorter! Then they stretched hours made them longer much longer. You use to work m-f but they took that away as well.
12 hour shifts 30 minute lunch 4-3 days a week. If you have a family it’s not very family friendly schedule as well all know kids are only out of school during summer and weekends.

You really have no room for advancement but they preach that you do.

They on a coporate level have good values but at a working level those are not displayed

If your a female you will really struggle. Females are not treated fairly or given as many opportunities.

Holiday pay doesn’t cover your time off work anymore. Sick time only covers a staffing model of people who work 8 hours not 12."

Internal tools are ineffective and significant effort is wasted doing day to day job due to tools issues (unless the issues directly impact revenue, no one cares if a project manager spends 6-8 hours per week trying to fix issues due to poor tools)
2. Of all managers I've had in my career, the worse ones have been at Microsoft by far - seriously, lower level or mid-level managers are terrible and since we change managers every year and sometimes more, anyone that has been a Microsoft a while has had experience with several managers.
3. Expect delivery to go well when more than half the team is inexperience and right out of college (but the customer rates don't reflect that). Customers DO notice and the delivery team takes a hit by constant customer complaints

But over 20+ years I had three decidedly bad managers. It's totally fine that I worked for managers that I don't get along with; but the problem is that Microsoft gives senior managers a HUGE amount of control over an employee's career path with no checks and balances. If you work for a senior manager with whom you don't get along AND they give you a bad review, then it is very challenging to move forward with your career. HR will listen to your concerns, but they don't have the power to insert you somewhere else. Instead, the new manager will put a lot of weight into the old manager's reviews."

-Lack of Strategic Connection between HR Leadership team and the broader org. HR Leadership team seems very detached from the business and HR team realities.

Level: HR roles are levels very low in comparison to the leadership teams they support. I’ve been in other organizations where the HR partner role is mapped within a similar peer group as the direct reports to the main business leader supported.  In Microsoft, an HR partner is usually between 2-4 levels below those of the supported organization leadership team and +5-7 levels below it’s main business customer. This creates a real gap in the experience/ maturity level of the partner and the supported leadership team, which does not allow the function to really step up at the strategic level the function expects. 

-Workload: HR partner orgs are extremely lean and not only interacting with the direct business customer bit also with a number of COEs in HR, which is similar to other models. However, the big level of variability between one org and the other is such that the HR partner ends up filling a number of gaps without the appropriate resources to do the job. COE’s are also very disconnected to the business strategy and needs which often results in the need to customize. There’s opportunity for better alignment.

Empowerment: Given the two items above, the HR partner role is not as empowered as what I’ve observed in other similar roles with much smaller business scope.

Long work hours: You can expect very long work hours.

Career progression: very slow. Talent stay very long years in their roles. Due to the limited number of VP roles, growing to a leadership level position is very unlikely."

Even top performers will be asked to go eventually, since they promote folks  into a band without their consent (but you'll like it because comp will go way up at first).

The statement ""everyone has a personal truth"" means you can get in trouble for anything.  There are even policies about words and phrases to use that HR wants you to use, but if those preferred words and phrases offend someone you are in trouble.  And there are quiet talks by managers about how the rules are different for white men.

5528,Microsoft,3.5 Stars if I could,2020-01-29,3.0,Senior Market Research Manager,"Work-life balance is typically what you make it.  They (both Corp and stakeholders) will take as much of your time as you are willing to give, so know your boundaries and set them early.

The pay is good relative to competitors.  The benefits are excellent.  You work with intelligent, collaborative people (mostly).  You might be able to move on to a different role within the org or with another group like Engineering.

The new GM of CMR as of Fall 2019 seems genuinely interested in improving culture and providing development opportunities, which is promising.

No commute into downtown Seattle. :)","Middle management is a mixed bag.  I've heard some managers are great and others are definitely not so great.  Management with long tenure is a double-edged sword as institutional knowledge is valuable but it allows bad habits or practices to become more deeply ingrained. There doesn't seem to be any training for managers on how to actually manage high performing teams which definitely causes attrition. 

While official stack-ranking is no longer a thing, promotions are still largely dependent on favoritism (or fear of losing strong talent) rather than basic merit, as managers do not adhere to the promotion or level guidelines published by HR.  At each people review more employees are put up for promotion than can realistically be promoted due to budget.  

Not specific to CMR, but across Microsoft, there aren't any mechanisms for providing feedback on your skip manager.  Internal surveys ask about immediate manager and group manager, but that doesn't capture the entirety of the employee experience."

Microsoft seems to be continuously innovating their tech as of late, which is helpful to sellers.","Microsoft’s inside sales org in Irving, TX is called Digital Sales within Microsoft’s Small, Medium & Corporate business segment. 
When I joined Microsoft, I expected a world class and extremely formalized training program since the company was so large and talks about digital transformation with their customers. Microsoft was the worst and most impersonal onboarding I’ve ever had. They had you do a quick 2 hour meeting with an HR rep, and from there, you’re released to your manager. On day 1, I had boxes of equipment at my desk and was left to unpack and set up all my equipment myself. No one helped me get up and running to ensure I had a successful first day in role. 
Outside of the standard education videos, which are all more Microsoft and product focused, there was no formalized training to set external hires up for success within Microsoft digital sales. 
It surprised me that for a tech company, the sales tools available are very archaic and systems do not talk to one another. For example, I spent the first 2-3 weeks of my job entering Help Desk tickets with India just to wait on various system access and tools needed to perform my job. This added to what’s already a stressful time starting a new job. Dynamics is a very antiquated CRM tool (basically an electronic filing cabinet) & was cumbersome to maintain accurate sales records in the tool. 
Management within the org was highly political and would impose constantly shifting priorities that worked well for those in leadership to meet their scorecard metrics by creating business rules that forced reps to sell certain products for a management scorecard and jump through countless internal approval hoops if the product was not included in a deal. This led to many reps selling through discounting versus solution selling - setting a bad precedent for future deals. 
There was also a shift in how the specialists teams interact with the digital Account Executives. Some of the specialists used to be AEs and work as field-based resources, while other AEs have 100% inside-based specialists supporting their accounts. Seems like eventually Microsoft will pivot to eliminating either one group of resources or the other in the future. As a result, mandates come down for the AEs to upskill by taking various certification exams to achieve deeper proficiency in the workloads. This is fine, but it makes you wonder if the goal is eventually to try and eliminate some of the specialists. Often, it felt like they were trying to pile as much on the AE as possible when the AE role was explained to me as a generalist sales role. 
Many of the managers within digital sales are extremely duplicitous and political, which created a hostile work environment. Policies would be implemented very haphazardly without the proper training and context for the AE community to fully understand the new policies and adhere to them. 
Since it’s Microsoft, there are also a TON of resources (usually contractors) reaching out internally asking you to intro them to your customers or bothering you constantly to let them engage in your accounts. The issue is many of these resources are also inconsistent and not showing value, so you are having to filter through a ton of internal noise and requests for introductions on top of your daily work. 
The majority of the folks there seemed to be hanging on from when Microsoft first opened this sales org due to the relatively high pay for inside sales; however, many of these employees lack the basic skills and Microsoft knowledge to effectively do their job and take care of their customers - they are just there riding the wave. 
I’d advise against the Digital Sales AE role and Specialist roles in Las Colinas unless you’re have worked heavily in the Microsoft ecosystem and come to the role with that background and knowledge of what you are getting into. If you come from another software company, you will likely not get the enablement your need to effectively navigate the complexities of Microsoft and management’s constantly shifting priorities."

The managers at this company play politics and don't focus on anything remotely like work.

2. If you work in the Redmond location there are great commute options. 
3. Senior leadership is working actively to change the culture. Not just lip service but holding mangers accountable.  
4. The company is on a growth tear. (Just look at the stock price since Satya Nadella became CEO)
5. The benefits are amazing and getting even better.","There is a layer of management that has been here for 15+ AND is entrenched in a 'good old boys' culture. If you tow the line and kiss the ring you will be fine. Your good ideas are theirs and your bad ones are yours. 

Your career fate is tied to your manager. Promotion, growth and rewards are impacted by your impact on the business and equally on your ability to kiss the ring. Make sure you have a manager that supports you or quickly find another manager. 

My advice is don’t take any role that doesn’t have high visibility. Avoid any role that involves the regular running of the business. That is thankless work.

If culture and inclusion are important to you, avoid Microsoft for now. If this doesn't matter, welcome on board."

Other managers, in attempts to justify their own roles and existence, make up side projects for mid to upper management that never serve a purpose to our clients yet they cannot perform the basics in their own role. Leadership is incompetent enough to fall for this charade time and time again, meanwhile the managers that aren’t busy brown nosing are the ones keeping the business afloat.

Due to highly competitive nature there is a lack of collaboration
High expectations without a concrete goal - often times, managements expects you to work hard, make impact etc, without any clear goal or objective. 
Not the best place for women for a long term career.  Microsoft in general is trying hard to improve its image about gender bias, however, in technical role, with close to 90% male employees it is not a good environment for women to stay long term.  

For short term this is a great place to learn and having experience in Microsoft goes a long way in your resume. I would recommend Microsoft as a place to start your career, then, have a exit strategy before you burn out. 
The culture and work schedule / demand will take up most if not all of your time. This is a highly competitive place and demands all your attention and energy, which in turn can cause lot of stress.  As long as you can work hard to get the great review, this will be a good place for you.  You should plan to leave as soon as you realize that you are not able to keep up with the demand."

I ended up in hospital and was fired, so I asked for preferential rehiring and HR informed me I had ""never been fired"". When I talked to a co-worker (a fellow Product Advisor) about it she forwarded the email she was sent, that DETAILED MY TIME IN HOSPITAL as the reason for my FIRING, sent from my BOSS.

Admins are treated as less than, are low level making it very difficult to advance into higher roles.  There are no repercussions for managers harrassing their employees, or directly discriminating against them.  HR dismissed my claims when the evidence was clear and in writing.

The global team is very welcoming.,"Leadership in the organization I worked it has progressively gone downhill.  No longer do they care about building  a strong team, and only focus on metrics and producing deliverables with the least amount of manpower/head count.  Local leadership will find every possible way to tell you how the team is not performing well, and will routinely spin metrics to hide the flaws and gaps in process and workflow.  All the while touting transparency, and fairness.  Yearly required training talks about these concepts, but locally they are not evangelized.  If your output starts trending downward, they will literally push you out in front of the bus.  Local top leadership is expecting blind loyalty and obedience, and will burn you out if you don't.  The once great team, is now just a shell of it's past self and being decimated by poor senior leadership."

Microsoft has had it’s ups and downs over the years, but is as good a place to work now as it has ever been.","Work life balance is a challenge since there is always more to be done.

Building a culture where people are truly valued and not just a replaceable cog in the machine. Lots of opportunity and great things happening at this company. Compensation is good including great bonus and stock possibilities as well.","Commutes are ridiculously long in Redmond, even with transportation options provided by the company. Most senior managers live close so maybe they don't feel the pain. I spend 2-3 hours per day on the company bus (but at least there is WIFI, so it isn't a complete loss). Some groups are ok with regular remote work, while others insist physical presence everyday. It would be nice to see more allowance for working remote 2-3 days a week to take commuters off the road.

Difficult internal mobility. Internal transfers are treated like external applicants. I applied for both internal and external jobs and got a senior software engineer offer from Google, while in parallel, I got rejected for an internal team because I messed up a LeetCode ""Hard"" interview problem in my internal interview rounds.

6037,Microsoft,So far so good; early impressions of new job,2019-07-10,4.0,Verification Engineer,"Industry leading compensation and benefits, good culture, very comfortable workplace environment. They will do whatever it takes to enable you what you need to do your job. Other tech companies it can be a nightmare to just get the basic things you need to do your job but here they go out of their way to make sure you have what you need and are comfortable. Honestly the office is so high end and all my stuff is so nice, I don't even want to go back to my crappy apartment at the end of the day.

The work life balance has been really great so far. I previously worked at a company that everyone claims is the best for work life balance and it wasn't. Lots of people say it is bad at MSFT but I haven't experienced having to work evenings and weekends yet but I'm still new (< 1 yr). So far my manager is fantastic - really invested in my success. I'm hoping it stays that way.","I've heard horror stories from ex-employees and one does not need to go far to find them on the internet. None of that has been my experience so far. There are over a hundred thousand people working here so I don't doubt some teams / organizations could be more miserable. I also work at a satellite office where it is more laid back than on the main campuses.

The downsides I have experienced is it's easy to get out of the loop / disconnected from the other engineers on teams that aren't directly associated with your own team, but teams that you need to work closely with to get your job done efficiently. In other words: it's a big company and it's hard to organize multiple large teams spanning multiple time zones. 

I also am working on a relatively small piece of the puzzle. It seems many people run the risk of being silo'ed. They move people around periodically to prevent stagnation. This isn't really an issue to me because I will do whatever it takes to remain employed so the idea that one should have to always be engaged in the most important tasks etc. has always kind of felt like a giant sentiment of entitlement that most of my millennial cohort adopt so this is not really a con to me.

And who knows, they could fire me next month and revoke my starting bonus and I might be singing a different tune."
6038,Microsoft,The pay is at least partly for putting up with how inept middle management is.,2019-07-11,2.0,Senior Technical Writer,"Good pay, some of the people you work with can be really nice depending on wher you land.","Expect your performance to be based more on your ability to essentially sell yourself and interview for your own job over an over. You will be assessed not on how good your work is or how much you do, but how good your work makes your management look. Helping the customer is considered a distraction."

* Experience can be very dependent on your org/ team. I feel very lucky to have found the team I was on. 
* Hard to work with some teams that seemed more obsessed with process vs the common goal of delivering good product. E.g., I know security is important and security reviews are important, but if you only offer office hours a few hours each week, refuse to meet any other time, and you're booked out for months, that's not good enough. We need to work together to solve problems, not create artificial barriers."

Relaxed atmosphere in the office.

Pretty good campus. Convenient location and commute options.

Easy to switch teams, and lots of different projects to choose from.

Very open source friendly internally these days.

Can be very flexible on schedule and even remote work, depending on the subdivision. There's no corporate-wide anti-remote policy, like in some places, and no informal bias overall, but some teams are much more open to it than others. Ask, and you shall receive.

""Stability"" is the key word permeating everything. If you like that, this is the place to be. If you'd rather take significant risks for great rewards, probably best look elsewhere.","Management higher up tends to chase their written commitments too much, beyond common sense.

Career advancement is generally slower than in other similar companies.

Less of an ecosystem bubble than it used to be, but still a bit of a bubble, especially in Windows. If you are in the wrong spot for too long, it's easy to end up being an expert with a skillset nobody really needs outside the company."

Work-life balance is possible but can be tricky depending on customer location and whether the customer requires 100% onsite (e.g. many Federal customers). Benefits package is actually worthy of comparison when adding to total compensation.  Rewards often match output, especially if you learn what your management/senior leadership are looking to quantify for the region or team's overall performance. 

Access to mentorship can be challenging in Services as opposed to the Engineering or Sales areas, but you have access to most of the company and if you put time into networking, it can definitely be done. Access to some of the best minds and best training in the world, but you need to set good boundaries to balance time spent billable vs training and keeping up. They factor in training time, but you have to schedule it at regular intervals and make sure your customer(s) is/are happy with timing","Challenging for those who have a hard time self-promoting (have to balance between highlighting good/great performance while remaining humble. This is not a company for insanely bright solo performers who have no ability to share their knowledge - a high premium is placed on building upon the success of others (generally not starting from scratch) and promoting the success of others (e.g. build things in such a way that they meet best practices and can be reused in others' projects. In my mind, this aspect is a pro, not a con, but for those who want to go ""lone cowboy genius"" this is not the place for you unless you are really willing to stretch yourself.

While our software is great, our internal tools need work. Things like timekeeping and customer records are accurate but have quirks that make them tedious to use. While management is aggressively looking to replace these, it is slowly progressing. Not the biggest con if you come in expecting it, but it is a bit disappointing given the caliber of the company.

Finally, there are pockets of services where the customer contracts have been written with very little protection for the PFE or Consultant - you may be asked to do something ridiculously out of scope or unreasonable from a man-power/schedule perspective. While this is not generally the case, you will need to network your way through the situation (leverage peer assistance), while working with the Account team to adjust scope. Some contracts may be so bad that you need to quickly rotate out. However, there truly is plenty of opportunity to move around - you are not hired for a single slot like most other services companies."

You come in and the pay is great, work life balance etc. But, over time you start to stagnate and work becomes this 9-5 thing you're comfortable doing but not really excited about. I think that about sums up 90% of the people here. 

Also, depends on your team but they really just stick you somewhere out of college. No matching based on skills really. Moreover, your manager can be all over. Compared to a startup, you just won't learn or grow as much. A lot of people who are 'comfortable' are here and like just sitting around. Not really any sense of urgency.

As a highly educated and senior leader who is a woman of color, I felt repeatedly excluded by the white women in my organization, particularly those with historical/seniority status. They had very subtle exclusionary behaviors that can’t be “written up.” Examples include: talking about me behind my back, which I heard from another colleague; discounting/ignoring my contributions and ideas; greeting only each other in the office and not initiating social conversations with me; seeding doubt about my project outcomes and timelines by telling the executives that we weren’t going to hit our timeline and budget.

Of course it's done verbally behind closed doors and for seemingly unrelated or non-specific reasons, but it's there.  The politeness you see around the company is a thin veneer over the sheer toxicity this company's management has.

The company separates employees into three categories: college hires, industry hires, and internal transfers.  Industry hires are people with experience outside of Microsoft since college. If you're of those then run! They'll treat you like crap. So many good engineers are pushed out of the company.

Judge the CEO by what lower management acts on.  It's not a pretty picture. 

Here is an indication of how toxic the work environment is: if you have more than 5 years of Microsoft experience on your resume, the industry will treat you like ""damaged goods"". You may not be employable after that. I'm getting out while there's still hope for me.

Excellent benefits.,"No one cares...   your boss, they better be strong and have backbone and conviction or you may experience an awful work environment.  This isn’t similar to other companies, this is a constant within Microsoft. Let me give me context.  Yes - MICROSOFT is obsessed with diversity but this also means that often the best qualified person didn’t get the job.  I’ve watched this happen time and time again.  When you interview or “loop” if there isn’t enough diversified candidates then MICROSOFT will redo the interview process - EVEN if a highly qualified candidate was available.  

Every year there’s a high probability you’ll end up in a reorg.  In 5 years I was caught in 4 organizations.  Unproductive and confusing to both employees and customers.  MICROSOFT is not customer obsessed.  Moving roles constantly makes it hard to know your customer well and add value.   Every year my new customers made it a point to let me know how upset they were with the constant shifting.  

This is a company you go to out of college then leave!  There’s little stability and unless you’re a minority (which I am, a woman) you’ll struggle with promotions even if you’re a rock star."

- Consistent amount of hours (as long as you aren't demanding full time).
- Lots of resources for developing your own skillset and networking. 
- College reimbursement is great for students.","- Working outside of your sales role is discouraged by management, many times that discouragement is indirect. Management tells you that there are no borders in terms of upward mobility and that you're encouraged to work outside your role if you want to move up; This is complete nonsense. Management will discourage this since they are under tight budget constraints and don't have the approval to pay what many of the employees are actually worth if they were to use their full potential. 
- There's a bit of kool-aide in that they talk about your ""Career at Microsoft"", however it is very rare that skilled individuals move up in the store. Promotions and raises seem to be based on diversity hiring tactics and favoritism rather than merit, ability, and professionalism foremost. 
- Depending on who your managers are, they will treat the job like the typical retail experience; The metrics they use to measure success conflict with the message of customer service. This often leads to management pushing product and subscriptions which might not be the best fit for the customer, but is instead most profitable for the store.

6238,Microsoft,Excellent employer on the whole,2019-02-24,5.0,Software Development Engineer II,"If you are fresh out of college, this is one of the best companies to work for. Like many other tech companies, there's a big emphasis on work-life balance and community building. In a lot of ways, it will feel like an extension of college in terms of the learning and events with other young professionals. Senior developers are, for the most part, very happy to mentor younger people and instill a sense of discipline. Internal mobility is fantastic as well, moving from team to team is relatively frictionless and it's Microsoft, so there's a team for almost any area you want to work in. There are so many resources that there's an expert for basically anything you want to know. There's tons of young professionals around too and Seattle is a great place to live. Pay is competitive with the other top companies at a junior level.

Exit opportunities are great here as well. If you pay attention and put effort into your work, you will come out with a brand name that recruiters all over want to see, as well as a disciplined, rigorous skill set to match.","As you move up in ranks, the pay disparity between Microsoft and its competitors (Google, Amazon, Facebook) starts to grow, with Microsoft developers making substantially less than their counterparts. For some, this is okay if they value lifestyle more than career progression. For others, it's common to jump ship to another company.

As with any other big company, there's layers and layers of bureaucracy. For most mature teams, all work will be carefully planned months in advance, specced, discussed in multiple team meetings, with dedicated PMs and testers. In the beginning this is good because it teaches the absolute best, gold standard way to develop large software. After a while, it can become very dull and repetitive though.

The annual review system, which invariably involves peer feedback and encourages backstabbing peers, can be maddening. Even after spending several years here, most people will find it's hard to break off of the railroaded promotion system and really shine as a superstar, just due to the seniority-based culture and siloed nature of the work (you don't have the expertise to move into a management role or more technical area that's already being done by someone more senior, but by never doing that role you'll never build expertise).

Also your experience is hugely, hugely team dependent. Local team culture matters way more than anything that happens at top management level. Two employees at two different teams can have drastically different lives. Maybe the things I list as pros are actually cons in your team, and vice versa. Unfortunately there's no real way to tell what it'll be like working on a team until you actually start working there. You can gauge the number of young vs old developers to get a sense of the culture though.

Despite this Microsoft is still a fantastic company, no regrets after having worked here for 6 years. The opportunity to work alongside world-class engineers to ship code that all modern versions of Windows use has been a privilege."

However, the new vision/direction and improvements are not consistent in all divisions/functions.",Certain businesses like Cloud + Enterprise and business functions like Marketing are highly dysfunctional. Middle management does not align to the company values the top leaders are driving. The top leaders leave it to middle management to execute on that vision but it's done poorly at the expense of the individual contributors that are abused and threatened by poorly equipped managers.

As a seasoned HR professional, I am appalled at the bait and switch strategy that was used to get me to join Microsoft. I have over 7 years of strategic HR Management experience within the tech space and left an amazing company/team/boss to make one of the worst decisions of my life.

I was told coming in that I would supposedly be doing ""big"" things, but I quickly realized that I was just another cog in a big wheel. I spent the majority of my time (90 percent) writing emails to people about what I might do to get buy-in and permission rather than spending time actually executing. 

Overall, the organization is filled with gossipy, rest and vest types. I also witnessed a very bright young African American female employee verbally abused and viciously bullied by her manager while senior leaders turned a blind eye. For all of you out there, I would think long and hard before joining the HR function at Microsoft.  Don’t say that you weren’t warned."

HR will not help file-rank employees, their main mission is to protect the business unit kingdoms.

Satya Nadella is a CEO that cares for himself and that is well known.  He looks down at people that are not as smart as he is.  He claims he is average person to people and dresses down for the new Microsoft look.  The company has to hire women as they have to show that they are not discriminating.  This is not a new trend but now a unwritten one where Women are given the promotion in order to show the world they do not discriminate.  The company is political and only cares for the top executives who pass out favors to those that are buddies.  They are fortunate not to be audited by the US government again for antitrust.

- Workplace environment is relaxed

- Does not pay nearly as much as Amazon or Oracle 
- Job might be easy, but it's very linear. You will definitely need something to distract you from the boredom.
- Gossip and backstabbing is like wildfire in this particular location of Microsoft.
- Does not offer any holidays off at all, unless requested. And only 3 people per shift can get them off. Everyone else is stuck here on holidays. (upside you get double pay if working on holidays).
- People get hired here with subpar knowledge on how to do the work, which has caused a high turnover rate of talent. 
- Very little to almost no career opportunities in terms of promotions. Most people have to move out, in order to move up. This also sorta ties into the talent having a higher turnover rate.

* There are so many orgs and teams working on drastically different things. If you get bored at one team, you have options to switch teams within the company. There's no limit for how many times you can switch teams.

* Even though the company is huge, I feel the org and teams are tightly connected. You come across familiar faces in the hallway multiple times a day, people nod their head or smile at you even though they may not know your name

* Benefits and pay may not be the best, but it's great given how many hours you put in. The 401k with 50% match (up to $9,250 in 2018), ESPP, HSA, etc are awesome and serve as a great vehicle for preparing for retirement (early). If you are lucky enough, you can take shuttle/Connector to go to work without having to drive.

* Compared to my previous employers, Microsoft is the best, and I feel privileged every day I work in the company","* Pay can be more in line with competitors, a few engineers I know voted with their feet

Good work-life balance and perks (at Silicon Valley campus) including fitness classes led by instructors, catered bfast/lunch, and dinners when staying late (depends on org).

Program manager heavy - many PM's overseeing schedule, but over the 4 years that I was there, I saw the same scheduling mistakes occur constantly.

You're encouraged to move around within the company to find a good fit--but you still have to go through a lengthy interview process with the new team each time.","Work/life balance seems to be slowly declining across the company. There are no QA teams anymore in most places (because quality is the devs' responsibility) but it's rare to find a team that is willing to allocate enough time to actually write sufficient tests. This makes it hard to write code at quality without just working extra hours.
The company is constantly reorganizing its hierarchy (about twice a year) leaving lots of projects in chaos. I have many times had our successful product moved to another team simply because ""it's not in our charter anymore""."
6438,Microsoft,Good company with bad mid-level management,2019-01-15,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great work life balance if you enjoy getting paid by probably the highest pay rate per working hour in the industry while working minimum amount

Work flexibility is good if you are one of the mid-level management's favorite children. Some of my coworkers have ridiculous amount of vacation or out of office days.

Good benefits, the company takes care of its employees.

Opportunities to explore and employees are encouraged to move around inside the company although you must go through an interview process or a ""loop"". Given the size of the company, you will find a role truly excites you.

Nice and smart people to work with and to learn from.","Just want to claim that below is only witnessed in my org and not sure will be applicable to the whole company. But I'm sure certain patterns are the same across the board.

Politics or clique is a big issue at the company. The CEO is trying to change the company culture. However, you will find strong resistance to the change from many long-time employees. Some people managers are so fake and pretend to care about you. Instead, they will manipulate and twist messages to guard their jobs and step on your head for promotion. Backstabbing is common to benefit one's own career development. 

Conversations are not inclusive, and communication is bad. When you are unfairly treated, there is no place for your voice to be heard or for you to be understood. If you try to explain, you will be regarded as too defensive and not willing to embrace the growth mindset. When there's misunderstandings, basically my manager told me to shut up in a polite way. I also have been shut down multiple times by senior employees when I tried to help them understand things on a project.

Mid-level management don't know how to create clarity. They will use big and vague words to sound smart, but they cannot explain themselves when you ask follow up questions for details or clarification.

Talents have been leaving the team constantly and no one from management has any interest to investigate. Instead, they think that they are nurturing talents for the company. Some senior employees who stayed don't even know how to use our own technology."

You can be starting out anywhere from corporate, and go anywhere you'd like. From engineering support to marketing, software engineering to product planner, finance to hardware engineering. Anything is possible given you put into the time and effort to reach out and network with the people currently working in where you'd like to go, as well as developing the necessary skills for these jobs. Everyone is super busy (as expected), but they're all willing to put down what they're doing to give you some pointers or answer your questions, even if it's only for 15 minutes. There's no feeling of animosity towards your growth because people feel threatened by you; your growth is their growth too.

Outside of that, the company hosts many events for the employees and their families, the food is decently priced, and there are many on-campus services, from tech support, barbershops, live music, farmer's markets, happy hours, and more. The work/life balance is top-notch for a company that has so much on their plate.

2. Offices! Single occupancy offices for most of the Redmond-based employees!
3. Hierarchy is surprisingly flat in many parts of the company.

This is true at most companies, and it's certainly true here.  If you get along with your immediate manager, you will find your time here tolerable.","1. MS keeps dogfooding its products on employees and moving people around: both re-orgs and office moves.  The company has an optimizing culture that neglects its effects on humans.  Then they try to compensate in the worst way possible: corporate initiatives.  Growth mindset, inclusivity, etc.  They'll put up posters and send out emails that people just ignore or mock.
2. They are gradually converting offices to open space.
3. Tons of politics.  Much of the old guard feel obligated to justify their employment; they attempt to ""own"" as much as possible, usually to the detriment of projects and the mental health of individual contributors.

Good benefits. Great matching on 401k and charitable contributions. Working with smart people. Saying you work for Microsoft.,"You truly have to enjoy politics to work here. This company is more about popularity than productivity. 

Hierarchical, deep rooted long term relationships and loyalties in teams make it hard for new employees to be successful.

If you think you are here for the exciting technology you are fooling yourself. You must love Powerpoint and Excel to work at Microsoft.  You will spend 90% of your time building and finding decks and spreadsheets unless you are in a developer type role.

Microsoft sales teams are only customer focused when it's renewal or sales time. After the renewal,  if it doesn't make them money they do not care.

Our customers use our technology more than we do. We are just beginning to fully implement Microsoft Teams almost a full year after our customers have struggled with it.  

Our internal systems are awful. Our vast IP is in so many places and so difficult to find you will spend days trying to find a Powerpoint Deck. Trying to find a internal resource is even more difficult. 

Partners still rule and the Services Group is the red headed step child of the organization. Avoid being employed on the Services side of Microsoft if you want a long term career.  Services will never hit their numbers and are considered to be a drain on the organization as a whole. 

The leadership is also lackluster and out of touch. They are so concerned with promoting women, due to a recent lawsuit, they are promoting incapable women in positions they are not qualified for. I am a woman and while I appreciate the change in Microsoft's position on hiring women, they belittle me when they hire women not because they are the best candidate but because the need to make their numbers. More women suffer under their poor leadership than succeed because of a hiring quota percentage."

There may be some competitors who pay more in comparison but most employees with competitors are miserable and dying for a good culture. Culture at Microsoft is amazing and extremely important. Everyone is very collaborative and they want to help you succeed for the most part. The opportunity once you enter Microsoft is honestly endless. You can make about as much money as you can possibly imagine, and do any job you’ve ever really wanted to do. You can also move almost anywhere you want to move. Most roles have a ton of opportunity to work remote, which is my favorite part. I accomplish so much from home, and without the travel time on a daily basis I finish more than I normally would. Work life balance is great and an emphasis- they encourage you to enjoy your time with your family. Ultimately that’s up to you if you can separate the two.","Lack of training. Even when provided with training events, seems the facilitators or the training material is way over your head at that point in Microsoft. Once you gain a better understanding of your role, that naturally comes with time, you’ll really wish someone would’ve explained everything to you like you were 5 years old from the get go. It seems they try to go level 500 immediately rather than giving overviews, and this goes for a lot of different initiatives throughout the company. Rather than trying to sound extremely smart with 30 slides with 500 words or more per slide, get to the point and speak in simple terms that we will understand and can portray to our customers."

- Compensation and benefits are generous
- It's a family friendly company if you're at that stage in your life and want to slow down
- The company is financially stable ( for now )","- The ratio of PMs to engineers is ridiculous. There are only a handful of engineers for every PM in my org. Our backlog keeps growing, while the features with the best ""visibility"" and the least amount of investments gets resourced.

- Many of the PMs are non-technical. They've landed this job due to dumb luck, then wonder why the over-worked engineers can't get this done faster. When work items take longer than expected, IC PMs are pressed to ask them to ""work faster"".

- The more talented people at the company leave. Those who stay are the ones who can't get jobs with similar pay elsewhere. Those who stay and take on work with great ""visibility"" great promoted. This means that product planning tends to be short sited. Seniors only want to work on something they can get done before the next review period.

- It's getting more difficult to recruit. PMs are joining in increasing numbers from non-technical domains. They may have domain knowledge in the space, but they're not engineers. This is going to  exasperate the problems I mentioned above.

- Upper management is very disconnected from the reality of building software in the modern age. Most of them haven't touched code in decades, or have been around since the early days of the Internet. They think we are a first-class engineering company, yet we don't have real time metrics, continuous deployment, technical debt controls, testing...

- Not agile, despite at the rhetoric.

- We're so much on building a culture around everything except having a great software engineering team."

Steady paycheck. Great medical benefits.,"- The amount of time spent in Powerpoint is egregious. STOP wasting so much time “telling the story” and build some freakin’ customer centric features.

- Program management is not product management.  They literally don’t have the modern product skill set. They have a project management/timeline based skill set and therefore, it needs to be handed over to UX immediately.

- Engineering has little accountability. Once a year, on every team, it becomes clear that engineering is taking their sweet time and using technical obfuscation (everyone else’s lack of tech stack knowledge) to buy more time.

- Engineering has WAY too much input on experiences which they have no expertise in. I can’t tell you how many devs I have had to “convince” to do the right thing for customers. I appreciate collaboration, but devs are in a role to help execute the strategies of UX and product management, they don’t need to have input into the strategy, just the tech efficiencies within it...because you aren’t qualified or empathetic enough to do so.

- Once you become a senior, suddenly just being great at your job is not good enough and in order to receive any small portion of your already peanut sized bonuses, you will be expected to go “above & beyond” your role and will be viewed as an under performer if you don’t. It’s insane that a 100k person company would expect anyone to stand-out. It is a waste of time, just reward people for doing their jobs well and leave people alone."

6714,Microsoft,Honestly Pretty Shocked,2018-09-15,2.0,Finance Manager,"Satya Nadella is a truly spectacular leader, as well as Phil Spencer. I honestly loved working for both of them and knew that what I was contributing to was an inspiring vision and mission! The benefits at Microsoft are outstanding, the events are a blast and are a fantastic motivator throughout the year , the opportunities for growth and diversity in your job... some of the best I’ve ever seen. Microsoft also is in a serious growth phase so it’s an exciting time to be a part of the organization!","I’m still pretty shocked at my experience since day 1. I’ll try to leave emotion out of it and share the historical events that occurred to remain truthful and not exaggerate. When I first came in as an MBA here, I was brought into my dream finance role. 24 hours after joining, my manager went on paternity leave for about 8 weeks. I heard from him a couple of times in that timeframe and that was about it. I got started working on some onboarding projects and everything was more or less fine. My office was on the other side of the building so I didn’t get to sit next to my team for the first 7 months. My teammates never really came by to say hi so it was tough to build new relationships with them, having to walk over constantly to try to connect. After my manager returned, he only talked to me a handful of times. I’d say I sat in about 8 hours worth of 1-1’s over my whole year there. I never received a performance review or feedback on a single project. I never received a quarterly or year end performance review. I never heard that I did well, but was reassured that that wasn’t my manager’s style. He’s never really one to say “good job”. Not great management. I never felt like I was wanted in that role, and I heard from numerous people that I was placed in that role by a recruiter and was never actually placed in an open role and thus I wasn’t really wanted from day 1. 

Now for the part that I still am just in shock around. In my organization, I was the only white person. About 3 different times, in team meetings, jokes were made about how I wouldn’t understand something or couldn’t relate because I was white and not Asian/middle eastern. I just brushed it off and laughed, but felt like I experienced a form of racism that I had never felt before. Having not felt like part of the team ever and then had them make jokes about my race at my expense... it really didn’t feel good. But, because I’m Caucasian and not something else, if never felt like I could say anything about it because it’s Seattle and many people believe racism against Caucasian people isn’t possible. I would disagree based on my experience.  

At the end of my time, after declaring I was leaving, I never heard from a single HR rep. I had so much I needed to share and I didn’t even get an email about my departure.  Nothing. Zero. No form of exit interview. No goodbye. Nothing. So now I’m sharing this all here because I didn’t get to share it internally. It was the strangest exit I’ve ever had. 

The moral is: people leave managers, not companies. Microsoft is a spectacular company, but my management experience was really, really poor and HR really dropped the ball here. I was so sad too having come into my dream job and feeling unwanted completely from day 1. I would’ve stayed if even one person showed that they cared in the least. I had shared this with multiple friends there on my last day who had been there for years and they were in utter disgust and shocked that HR had never reached out. They reached out on my behalf and even that didn’t trigger a response. 

I’m just really shocked and sad. I was really excited to build a career at Microsoft and chose to leave due to this experience."

6853,Microsoft,Technical Solutions Professional (Sales) - Dont do it,2018-07-30,3.0,Technical Solutions Professional,"Lots of perks working for a big company like Microsoft; free Azure, MSDN access, discount on Microsoft hardware and software.","You don’t want to do technical sales at Microsoft.  Technical sellers are the most undervalued roles in company.  When its convent, management will speak of its technical sellers as “sales.”  But when it comes to compensation, the technical seller is dead last.  Technical sellers end up doing most of the sales motion (qualification, sales, licensing, pricing & solution estimation) but have little if any upside.  As a technical seller, you can easily work 50+ hours a week with nothing more to show for it than a pat on the back.  You’ll be carrying a “Account Executive” and “Sales Professional” and some other “semi-sales” individuals that make up what they call an “Account team”.  However, seldom will any of those individuals say anything in a meeting other than to introduce themselves and say how they don’t know anything about the technology before passing the buck to the technical seller to run the show and all the follow-up.  Your account team will make double what you make and work about ¼ as hard as you do.  To make matters worse, 50% of your variable compensation will be at the discretion of your manager (no way shape or form dependent on your sales performance.)  One of many problems with this is the turnover rate of managers in the organization.  Microsoft has a very high turnover on their leadership teams (whether its new talent, RIF, change in business etc.)   I’ve had 8 managers in 5 years.  When it comes time to do our ranks (yes they do stack rankings behind closed doors despite what they will ever admit to) if you have a new manager or someone who isn’t networked well, you will likely get a low rating and low end of year payout.  What this means, is that as a technical seller while you are supposed to be more insulated from variability in compensation, this model does the complete opposite.  You’ll have huge swings in your pay from one year to another depending on who your manager is.  In fact, as I write this, I’ve had a $43K swing in my pay (unfortunately down) all within a year where I was one of Microsoft’s top performers (even nominated for club.)  Do yourself a favor, if you want to do technical sales, do not do it at Microsoft or look for a job title as a “SSP – Solution Sales Professional” or “AE – Account Executive” where you can make twice as much, have less variability/risk in your pay, and work far less hours with way better work life balance."

There isn't really a ""management culture"" here unlike other big/mature companies I've worked at.   Some managers are promoted for being a good IC which means managing up and not being interested in coaching.  It's very subjective what makes a top performer and varies by group.  They're changing the review process but its still opaque. 
Big company with lots of politics.  Sometimes it feels like you're working in the government and not in the fast paced tech sector.  Different groups will start similar projects, then senior managers lobby for each one and there's very little assurance that anything you create or run will continue into the next fiscal year (especially if there's a reorg).

Such a huge company that it's hard to make a real impact sometimes. You can do the greatest thing in the world and show 1000 people and still actually do nothing in the end. 

There is still a competitive nature between teams that really harms innovation. I've been blocked from doing work multiple times because teams didn't want me to help out of fear that I would get credit. It's bizarre to me, but it happens A LOT, and I suspect it's a holdover from the Balmer days."

Good benefits and lots of support.","Upper management is cultish, plays favorites and disregards feedback. The ""values"" are there for everyone else to be evaluated on and not necessarily applicable to upper management.  The time spent on connects and documenting your work can be overwhelming if you are looking to get recognized for your work.

At times, the work you do is not easy to connect to actual value and it is hard to justify the time and effort spent on it. Work/life balance at upper management is hardly existent.

Mobility between teams is dependent on headcount availability and you will chase an internal job the same way external resources are. Just because you work there (insert group name), that doesn't mean you can work here (insert group name).

Word of advice: 
Research your manager and make sure your ""priorities"" line up with his/hers. Depending on the person you work for, you may find that you can be pushed out in ways you never actually even conceived of. 

The ""partners"" are very adept at playing Microsoft's version of the game of thrones, using the ICs and lower management to advance their priorities.

Every company I've ever worked for talks about how important the customer is, but on day 2, they're forgotten. Microsoft seems to genuinely focus on what's best for the customer, and it's awesome to be in meetings where people actually bring that up, and make decisions focused on long-term customer satisfaction.

I honestly believe you can be as awesome as you want here.","No cons, so far - seriously.

The vast majority of employees now feel proud to work for Microsoft compared to the Ballmer era.  Microsoft has great benefits (PTO, 401k match, new caregiver benefit, reimbursement for up to $800 in physical fitness, etc.) and flexible work arrangements.   Work can be very rewarding and you have the ability to make a real impact on the world.  The yearly MSReady conference in Las Vegas for field roles is quite fun with lots of opportunities to learn and a great way to recharge.  Many friendly, intelligent, and hard-working people work at Microsoft.  You'll learn a great deal.","Limited Career Advancement Opportunities For Some People- 
If you don't live in WA state or nearby one of Microsoft's campuses, career advancement  is very tough unless you want to stay in a sales-oriented or 90%-travel position.   

Difficult and Time Consuming to Move Around in the Company:
The internal interview process to move into a new role or organization within the company is very slow (can take weeks or months), not at all transparent, and is a full-day interview experience just as external candidates have to face.  Competition is fierce but if you're persistent it's possible to land a new position.

Tools & Processes:
Employees continually have low marks on yearly polling regarding having the right tools, reports, and processes in place to get our jobs done effectively.  I haven't seen many improvements in the several years I've been here and don't expect many changes in the future either.

Compensation:
While the benefits are fantastic, the total compensation could be much better.  I feel that salaries and stock rewards are falling behind compared to other top tier tech companies."

Saw countless requisitions that were closed with hundreds of candidates not viewed with an offer in the first slate of candidates sent over.  Racist managers acting as if they care when they truly are just providing lip service to employees.  If you have different views on certain things in life that doesn't go along with the culture you will be ousted from the organization instead of being put on a stretch assignment to grow into your career goals.

Everything needs buy-in from everyone, resulting in few decisions being made, and even less real work getting done. It's not how you do the work, or how much you're doing, it's only about the appearance of your work - even at the expense of others or actually not doing work.

Employees are valued only when assigned to bright-shiny projects, once those roles turn to run, or continuous improvement maintenance type roles, those functions are ""low value"" throwaway roles.  Exceptionally low organizational support to reassign talent from ""low value"" deemed roles, to absorb elsewhere in the organization.  Seems to be a huge loss of talent.

7183,Microsoft,Great company to work at,2018-03-20,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"I spent the last 14 years of my life at Microsoft. In the last few  years, the excitement was brought back by the new management. The new direction is clearer, more in line with  the industry needs.
There are frustrations there like anywhere else, but I always got the feeling that if you put some  effort into it, you could have a great career. And the different teams offer different cultures, so you can move around inside the company and  really keep the excitement going.
The people you work with are brilliant for the most part, and that is  definitely something I'll miss. Other companies have brilliant people too, I'm just saying that  most people at Microsoft I interacted with were really smart and it was great.
Most projects I worked on in Windows were really exciting, and touched the lives of millions of users. That's not something you get in all companies for sure.
Work-life balance is really good. I would say you  can control it: more hours will get you a better career, and that makes sense. Fewer hours  means less progression, but as long as you're doing a good job and meeting your  goals, you'll be  fine.
The use of telemetry and user feedback is getting really common and really helps deliver products that satisfy our customers.","Sometimes heavy infrastructure and processes, even though with the  shorter release cycles  have helped a lot with agility.
Sometimes, new V1 products do not feel like they're up to par with the legacy products they are replacing, then the V2 version often gets cancelled, so it sometimes feel like we are going slightly backwards in terms of functionality. Again, this seems to get better with the use of telemetry as we tend to focus on functionality that is most useful to customers."

You will have an opportunity to work with and learn from a ton of very smart people. You will enjoy good benefits.,"Some departments and mangers use gaslighting as the method of choice for obfuscating internal politics and manipulating department outcomes. If, for example, a department wants to stretch its headcount dollars to add extra heads without officially getting any new headcount budget, managers will make it their fulltime jobs to convert a sufficient number of good performers into bad performers through review management techniques that slingshot off a review system that requires an employee and the employee’s colleagues to serve up areas of vulnerability under the disguise of opportunities for growth. In reality, there is generally nothing egregiously wrong with the employee’s performance. It is just that the employee happens to have fallen into the path of the manager’s short-term measure of success and so will be chewed up and spit out.  Generally, you became this person by performing well and being paid fairly for your first several years of good service."

You need to be constantly telling everyone how great you.  It's a ""beauty contest"" atmosphere where you always need to have portray how great you are.  Big drinking culture too.  Most company events havbe minimal food but unlimited drinks, so most people are wasted fairly quickly.  Management are doing their best not to get fired and as a result they do whatever they are told as it relates to hiring, firing and promotions.  I saw many firings where they told people ""your job is in jeopardy"" w/o giving actual specifics of what you did.  Once you hear that phrase, there is no turning back.  Meaning they want you out.

The big focus on AI and Azure/Cloud is now paying off and the company seems less like the dull corporate of old and more in touch with what's in the industry - e.g. widespread use of GitHub, open sourcing, Linux.
It's a great place to work and they do care about work/life balance though I gather this probably varies from team to team. Benefits are good too.",Too difficult to move around within the company. There have been some improvements in past few years but still you have to do full interview loops. In many ways it's easier to interview externally than internally which doesn't seem right to me.

You compete against some individuals in the stack rank system who are clearly gaming the system and not actually producing.  Minimal ability to grow professionally.

Our cultural/moral/values compass has clearly shifted, and strategies are in place to drive a more customer-centric approach (and many complexities beneath that).  Meanwhile many of the systems, tools, programs, policies, etc are playing catch up.  We're undergoing massive organizational change for a company this size as well.

Vacation accrual is fantastic. 90 percent of admin positions are hourly, and can often be as much overtime as you'd like to work. The role is very broad: you can dabble in a lot of disciplines. 

The company values have gentled over time to emphasize happier, healthier employees who don't feel worked to death.  Real commitment to good corporate citizenship.

As a company, very much likes to promote from within.","Admins are just not getting the comp packages they deserve.  Pay stalls hard in the 56-57 bands. You must be part of a two-income household to even pay rent, much less own, as a Microsoft admin.  You are not bonus eligible.  Raises run around 2-3 percent, which can be less than a rent payment.

It is a very broad position, depending on your manager. You clean offices for new hires, set up new PCs, negotiate for office space, may manage budgets. Responsibilities merge with the much more highly paid Business Manager position which can be very hard to get (and will always be underlevelled for an admin making the jump). 

Even at the VP and sometimes at the CVP level, you will be responsible for multiple calendars, with no real diminishment in group admin expectations."

Too many managers show favoritism and repeatedly reward their favorite employees with the best feature work, which leaves everyone else doing 'laundry' tasks.

The company does seem to recognize that big tech companies grind people down, and it tries to dilute the politics with one-on-one's, annual reviews, sabbaticals, etc., although most feel it is only partially successful.  However I'd rate it as better than most.  They also emphasize diversity, ethics and good business practices internally.

Some groups and products are doing well and getting better.","Low autonomy and creativity.  MS actually missed out on a patent from me because they gave me no support for the work.

Typical big-company tendencies such as fads, not-invented-here and blame-shifting.  
Some tools have been described (in anonymous internal polls) as at least 5 years behind; it's painful to sit and watch sometimes (actually all the time).  

Dogfooding instead of using the best technology.  ""Nobody else is using it at this scale"" -- Azure support for a tool that replaced something much cheaper and higher-functioning."

Do not be fooled that just because this is Microsoft that you are doing huge things. At the end of the day it is just another retail job. My over arching problem with the job leads to the hours. You are expected to work minimum 20 hours a week which is normal but, when you submit an availability and your managers do not adhere to it, then it becomes a problem. Being a student, time management becomes tougher especially since work is not the main priority. Also, Even when voicing my concern, it does not seem like it is being heard and the managers do not pay much heed to new hires.  I do not understand why part timers can only have 5 hour shifts and are required to work 4 days when it is completely possible to work less days and longer hours especially if those days happen to be the busy days for the store. I write this review in hopes for management to read this and hopefully address my concern. Also another con is that it is fairly high stress. You deal with a plethora of customers and the word ""no"" is never and option. You have to treat customers far above many different places and it's outstanding the lengths one is required to go. I understand that the customer comes first, but the way it is being approached is utterly wrong. To each their own and this is my opinion. There are other things as well but I believe that this is enough. Thanks for reading and please keep in mind that; again this is my own opinion and if you have other thoughts you are entitled to writing your own review and I am glad you have not experienced this."

Stack ranking in small groups (ie under 25 or so) lowers morale and discourages true teamwork. It can pit managers against each other and put them in the awkward position of having to explain a low ranking that's more about politics than performance and impact.

Benefits are very good. As some noted they used to be outstanding but like all companies they've had to cut HC costs. Still they continue to work on improving benefits where they can, like increasing company matching on 401k contributions and accelerating stock vesting...both relatively recent improvements
relatively flexible work options, home, office, customer site, mobile. Note: I was in a field office not Redmond, but I believe it's still flexible at campus","While I believe in Satya's vision for the company, the new reality of Microsoft at least for the next few years will be a constant risk of RIFs.   You have to be really adept at knowing which group to be in. It's like a giant game of whack a mole, you can get hit at any time for no reason regardless of how good your performance is.  
I personally know someone who won Platinum Club (highest sales honor) and less than 2 months later was RIFed. There is ZERO consideration of the individual or talent when it comes to a RIF.  While they do allow you to interview back in, it's sort of an empty welcome as you are booted out of the company and treated like a new hire, at least from an access and interview perspective. Also you are only given 2 months...not nearly enough time given the glacial speed with which MSFT recruiting teams move. I've been on both sides of this now.

They tout wanting outside perspectives but stick to old ways. It could be that the new CEO Satya Nadella's philosophy and management style has not reached all organizations yet especially the sales & business side. Senior management imposes a lot of accountability without providing authority, which can be dangerous for those not politically-savvy (like the long-timers).

Great people, amazing benefits, and top pay in the area. There are plenty of challenging projects and lots of development opportunities. It's a great gig...  while it lasts...","Microsoft Reno seems to not want employees with more than 8-10 years of experience. At the Reno office, we called it the 10-year curse, because that was often the time you'd be managed out. They focus a lot on their intern program with UNR, and that's because those are the people that will replace the tenured employees when they get laid off. It's highly frustrating that this is the norm, but I saw so many high quality employees pushed out this way.  I went from being identified as Key Talent one quarter with a high review rating to being managed out the next quarter, and nothing had changed about the quality of my work.  They didn't even have a rationale for this drastic change. I can tell you the rationale -- my salary, insurance, and stock options had become too expensive for their liking."

Most employees are eager to help others when asked and also have a ton of knowledge to share.
Reviews are leaner with the Connect process.  If you are lucky enough to have a good people manager, you should look to have a Connect every 2-3 months, which is great for helping to keep you on track and give you more accurate measurements of impact.
Azure is taking off and the focus is moving entirely to an engineering/developer mindset, leveraging Site Reliability Engineering (SRE).  The more you deliver that has direct impact the more you will be rewarded.","The Ying to the Yang is that while Connects are good, they are also limited to the discretion of the manager.  You will likely get at least 2 Connects a year based on organizational pressure to management; however, in some cases that is not always the case.  Even if you can represent significant impact in Connects, you are again at the discretion of the manager.  You manager can completely disagree and provide negative feedback and there is not much you can do about it other than to move internally to another team or organization to avoid a bad situation.
If you are an employee in operations, IT, or other service engineering discipline, you will need to know coding and deliver code.  This is where things are going.  If you cannot adjust to this new skill set and deliver against it, then you are going to be in a bad place.
While there is no ""bell curve"" with the new reward system, I have seen a significant amount of changes to how rewards are now distributed.  There is definitely the ""good ol' boy"" network and favoritism.  Likely not different than most other companies.  Key point is that while the new reward system sounded cool and looked good a few years ago, reality is catching up."

The Switch from no out-of-pocket health care to a high deductible plan with an HSA was tough, but I personally understand that the former wasn't sustainable. Note that Microsoft feeds the account and for a healthy family with not much more than regular maintenance health services, you can spend less than the company's contribution. This means the savings will grow and be available in retirement years.","The usual baggage that comes from a long-established company, like overuse of internal tools instead of industry standard tools, as well as entrenched processes and bureaucracies that can hinder agility and efficiency. This, varies from team to team, but several data points I've collected make this feedback relevant. There's progress being made, but in a company this big and old, it takes time. 

Competing against others who don't maintain a balance between work and life can leave you on the outside, and that's not uncommon here. Working hard and long hours can get you rewarded with opportunities and promotions, and it's hard to argue against this (if you're doing the work, I guess you should get rewarded). It's just demoralizing when choosing not to de-prioritize family can work against your upward trajectory."

It's so bad that there's actually a term for meaningful work to distinguish it from normal daily tasks: ""Impact"".  You're ""making an impact"" if you manage to actually do something that will improve customers' experiences or make other engineers actually more productive rather than waste more of their time.  FYI, at most companies I've worked with, ""Impact"" is the standard and a lack of impact results in termination of the employee, team, or the entire company itself.

Microsoft under Satya Nadella is paying lip service to the philosophy that made Microsoft great in the first place and has been serving other companies so well recently, but in practice the company is a bloated, ineffectual behemoth of failure.  Most of the people who brought the tech industry to its knees in the 80s and 90s got rich and got out, and they trained a generation of quiet, useless busybodies to replace themselves.  Anyone with any passion or dedication to quality got slowly extruded out the back end of the company over the last 20 years, until we got to this point where Microsoft abandons+reboots their failed phone platform every two years and makes laughably terrible moves like removing the Start Button and forcing updates on people mid-presentation."

It can easy to be drowned out in the mass of retail employees.  Operations roles can be swamped.  The retail employees are paid on the upper end of retail, but is asked to do a lot.   So you have to be a jack of all trades.  You can't just walk in, do your job, and walk out. 
 Your store manager can either be really good or really bad.  They are your main advocate, so they will make or break your job.  But upper management at corporate will listen if you pass it up feedback/problems (if you have any!) in the right way.  You can be overworked by the sheer variety of tasks you'll do, but that can be really good for your career."

The joke around the office is that it is not a matter of ""if"" you will get fired, it's a matter of ""when."" Everyone has a shelf life and it's just a matter of when you have hit yours.

If you're into philanthropy this is your company.,Your success has everything to do with whether you have a decent manager or not.

Senior leaders are measured on what they accomplish in a review cycle, then move on to a promotion and leave the mess of their short term success for others to be hit with.  Additionally, the constant re-orgs can sap energy and team synergy.  Microsoft is known as re-org central."

The employees here are also very talented. It's actually a funny balance, they are talented enough to be motivated, yet people aren't over-qualified (like some other tech companies) which means it's reasonable to work on a meaningful project.",It can feel bureaucratic (read: slow) at times. Not much different than any other large tech company.
8232,Microsoft,Changing... for the worse,2017-07-17,4.0,Principal Software Engineering Manager,"Lots of scope, lots of variety -- in my 15 years in the company I've worked in widely different divisions, on very different products.",Some of the focus on individual growth has lessened in the last few years. Managers with span of control of 15-20 are not uncommon; at that point it's impossible to provide good career guidance. Growth tools like mylearning and mentor have gotten scaled back to the nub. Instead of in-person classes taught by Wintellect we're now told to use the company-wide Pluralsight subscription for self-learning -- not the same thing at all.

There are lots of little perks that add up, like stayfit and access to tons of free training opportunities. Just have to take advantage of them.","It's still a very ""who you know"" environment when it comes to advancement. It still isn't a place where you can stay in one role for any extended period of time. You're expected to move up the chain, or you're likely to get moved out. Opportunities are more scarce the higher up you go, and you're not likely to land one of those opportunities unless you know the right people. Don't expect to move too far up the chain unless you're willing to move to the Seattle area, where everything is excruciatingly overpriced and, not surprisingly, staggeringly liberal. You're expected to make an impact, but it's difficult to get anything done because of outdated tools/systems combined with tons of red tape and equal numbers of managers and PM's competing for a slice of the spotlight."

- Good Benefits
- There are some fun products / franchises to work on","- In some departments, a constant 50-60 hours/week with no extra compensation is silently expected on top of strict core hours.  Only want to work 40 hours/week?  Expect to fall behind and be replaced by someone willing to do 50-60.
- Want to take a vacation?  Good luck finding someone to cover your work.  During a 40 hour period, I had to do 60 hours week before and 60 hours week after a 1-week vacation to stay caught up, and still had to use my vacation days.  Can't trade OT for time off.
- Depending on manager, feedback on performance may be good (early, actionable) or bad (too late, in-actionable).
- Mid-to-upper management is all about coming up with fancy-sounding ideas and initiatives full of buzzwords that everyone else is forced to follow, but in reality these ""initiatives"" tend to be poorly thought-out, huge time wasters, and are obviously only there to pad management's commitments so they get good reviews and bonuses
- Lots of office politics.  In many cases, advancement/bonuses/etc. are all about ""looking good"" to the right people, not actually being good at your job
- Constantly pushing good ICs to become mediocre managers instead of letting them become *great* ICs.  This results in ICs that are great at knowing one tech / area / etc. being forced to own multiple areas at a much lower level of fluency and be less effective.
- Microsoft as a whole feels relatively clueless about making new products that customers actually want.  Windows Phone is just one example of how Microsoft can totally shoot themselves in the foot, Skype hasn't had a major update in years and is losing ground to fast-moving newcomers, etc.  Depending on what you work on, there's a chance that it simply won't matter or exist in the next few years, which is frustrating."

It feels like you're entering a pretty special company, given its track record.  Regardless of anyone's strengths or weaknesses, you'll encounter some pretty smart people here and it feels good to work with capable people.  There generally feels to be a high standard of technical understanding without penalizing those who don't know everything.   Most managers and peers are friendly and helpful.  The facilities are modern and clean with amenities.  You should have just about any resource you'll need to do the best job you can.","Microsoft is a 10 ton behemoth with who knows how many teams, products, and organizations.  It's unreasonable to believe you can be satisfied with your job just anywhere.  Enjoyment of your job is highly dependent on what team you're on and the specific things you're responsible for.  Some organizations are bound to aging tools, codebases, and other technical debt issues that can make work stressful and uninteresting.

8383,Microsoft,Program Manager,2017-05-30,3.0,Business Program Manager,"Its Microsoft.  Always a top company.  Good pay and benefits.  And with so many products and regional operating centers, there is a lot of opportunity to structure a career however you want.  

Schedules are pretty flexible, but there is an unspoken rule/expectation to 'be online' to make up any time taken.  Work life balance is a Microsoft value.  And for the most part there is no problems taking time when you need it.  Plus there is a work from home availability.","There is too much management and it is top down management.  It is a constant energy suck to prove your value, why you are necessary to your job.  The need to do your day job at night is constant.  There are so many meetings and so much political games that morale is low.  If you are not a buddy with LT, you get a lot of crap thrown over the fence to you and I constantly fight to maintain my job ownership.   

People get promoted for very little (even being gone on parental leave for 6 months of the year!) and folks get promised a promo and don't get one.  And I cannot say enough to paint the appropriate picture of the review process here.  It is abysmal.  It takes hours to write and usually happens after your rewards for the year is already set.  And your rewards are not based on what you accomplished.  It is people's perspective of the value.  I have had a manager tell me I have not delivered anything in a year because my skip level doesn't see anything I deliver and isn't aware of its impact.  Yet my job is to keep things running smoothly so they don't receive any escalations.  Again, it isn't what you do in your job, it is what you did in addition to your job and how loud you showcase it.

While there are opportunities here, it is extremely time consuming to transition somewhere else.  If, stress the IF, you get an informational to discuss the job opening, it is even rarer that you get selected for the interview loop.  There is a common saying here, it is easier to leave Microsoft and come back then it is to transfer internally. 

While it is also a Pro, the benefits at MS are not what they used to be.  Pay is similar now to lots of companies.  And a lot of the pay is rolled up in your annual review, which includes a bonus and stock.  the bonus is below average and the stock only vests 1/5 a year.  So while your stock is part of your 'raise' you don't get any until 6 months to a year later.  And if you leave MS, you lose it.  So it is really a Con.  Healthcare is good but no longer free.  Employees have to pay out of pocket now based on HSAs and are taxed on employer paid portions.  It is viewed as a cost containment not a benefit anymore.    I hear from old colleagues they get better pay and benefits when leaving MS.  They felt undervalued here and when they leave they receive large bumps in pay and equivalent levels.

Overall, lots of companies compare with MS now whereas MS used to distinguish themselves with better than anyone benefits."

The technology is amazing if you are passionate about seeing the future, this is a great place to do it. Satya is a good leader who is genuinely trying to change the company for the better.","Its a big ship that takes a long time to turn, so many of the old mindsets are still highly prevalent in the organization.  The key ones are:
1) Arrogance: Yes, there are bright people here, but sadly people tend to believe their own press too much. 
2) Lack of customer centricity:  Linked to #1, people believe they know more than customer do. Frankly, customer is a concept on a ppt slide. Part of the problem is that all global roles are a) based in Redmond b) rarely leave Redmond c) not directly linked to the field where the work actually happens d) spend their time building playbooks and strategy videos NO ONE actually reads or cares about. 
3) Linking words with action: the follow-through is non-existent. You sit in a meeting and the person will say, I will drive that and come back. They rarely do. Its such a large company and globally you are disconnected from the business in many groups so the accountability is not there.
4) Leadership gaps: Leaders tend to be very isolated, at the CVP and GM levels, you engage them through their business managers who filter information to them.   Most leaders also are more focused on making partner than developing their teams, sadly. 
5) You have to be in the Enterprise side, the consumer side is a trainwreck, led by people who have no clue what they are doing. Its also not a focus (outside of Office) for Satya. If you are a strong retail person, you will quickly see many serious challenges. 

Satya is driving change and its the right change, but the challenge is that while he has replaced many of the Senior Leaders who didn't buy into his game plan, the next level of management (GM) is still firmly entrenched in the ways of the past so will take a long time to make Microsoft a customer-centric, people-focused, agile organization and by that time, the market will have already moved on."

Glad to see Satya  in charge (and ballmer long gone). Its a good time to consider MS!","Many things pop-up when you've been somewhere for decades, but one thing that I like to mention here is this HR policy, where even if you have years of industry experience, or even if you are technically qualified, yet you are treated as a college hire no matter if a hiring team might find you as fully qualified or not. 

Basically, hiring teams don't really get to see you in order to evaluate your qualification unless they have a req for a college hire. This means that you as a candidate have less opportunities since you are pushed into a smaller set of job-opening (and auto-rejected from industry-hire category), and you as a hiring team are being excluded from considering candidates that are technically qualified.

This seems insane, policy trumps qualification! 

It was like this when I joined back the end of the last century! Crazy that such an irrational policy is still the HR mantra.

I can  whine about stack ranking and such, but many people have in the past, so I'll let it go."

8753,Microsoft,stay away from Azure,2017-03-21,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Great concept for cloud services.,Microsoft Azure division is starting to mandate you live in Redmond.  Not really understanding this as this is the cloud services division on Microsoft and there #1 sales point is with the cloud you can be anywhere and access your information.
8754,Microsoft,Windows PM team,2017-03-14,4.0,Program Manager,"A lot of good people to work with who want to GSD. Microsoft needs to find these people and promote them quicker.
Management is looking at turning the company at large around, and it is really working. It is a big ship, so it does take longer than some can handle.
Good focus on career management and good opportunities for training/personal development.
In the right department of this huge company, there are great career opportunities, and a good chance to make a big impact. Right now the right departments seem to include Azure and the non-Windows portions of Office. LinkedIn might be interesting soon as well.","I can only speak to the Windows group, so the following should be taken with that caveat:
Not quite up to par as far as smaller, scrappy companies. Too many PMs running around trying to ""add value"" while a lot just scrape by doing the minimum. It's easy to step on toes if you want to make an impact, and it's annoying to watch others just coasting and getting the same salary.
Similar to the PM group, Dev and QA folks can be really hit or miss.
Accountability is something that seems to be lacking. KPIs are rarely tracked after a product ships, and any mishaps are just hushed.
Benefits like free lunches, booze, and good coffee are not found here. I really don't know why, since it wouldn't cost the company much and would significantly improve the culture and retention, but Microsoft seems to be stubborn in this regard."

If you're content to make so-so money in Sales, and like big company internal complexity, this is a good place","No real sales commission plan.  It is an annual bonus plan that is complex, very hard to understand, has both a soft and hard cap, and has a degree of subjectivity that can be risky depending on your management.  Also, inflexible.  You may be ""asked"" to cover something that you will wind up spending lots of time on but not get paid for.  Marketing for enterprise business solutions is very weak, mostly focused on collateral with corporate banalities that have little value.  Licensing very complex and leads to much time spent on customer satisfaction issues. 
Microsoft does not appear to want highly agressive type ""A"" salespeople, and maybe they just don't need them.  Hence, the comp plan.

 But, as I said, if you are OK with OK money and the caps, etc, go for Microsoft."

Then, during my last week before I was laid off, I was blocked from seeking an alternative internal position (the hiring manager was hinted to stay away from me) - even though I was looking outside my division and for a different type of role.

- A lot of turnover in the leadership ranks of the company as well as recruiting organization. Lose one or two here and there and that's the cost of doing business, but lose handfuls of high level people within a few months time and there is something else going on entirely. My experience was the latter.
- Innovation is at the core of Satya's principles and is on just about every powerpoint deck, the problem is though, with hundreds of thousands of employees it'll probably take 10 years for meaningful change in the way business is done has been solidified across the company. He took over in 2014, the bad old habits of sitting on the cash pile still plague innovation in 2017. This isn't an indication of bad leadership by Satya, he is great, but there needs to be more strategic changing of the guard in key areas across the company to speed up the process to remain competitive and breed thought leadership.
- So much of what managers are brought in to do is handcuffed by the Director level employees (at least in recruiting) that ideas from those closer to the work rarely are considered or even heard.

There were very obvious cliques and some of my coworkers were blatantly racist against me. Constantly stayed past the hours I was marked for, and was strongly suggested by management to not go on any breaks otherwise you'd get talked to or on a manager's bad side. If numbers and micromanaging wasn't shoved down our throats every waking moment I probably would have loved working here.

In a short amount of time, the CEO has helped to restore the company's image as that of an innovator rather than a follower, and made needed changes to help MS become more competitive in the cloud game. Customers and partners alike are excited about Microsoft technology again and that is exciting to see.","In my opinion, morale is now pretty poor mainly due to the abundance of unnecessary admin/processes, internal politics and poor management. There have been more than a few layoffs (wrapped into ""re-orgs"") in recent years and the practice of stack ranking employees has continued, although mgmt attempted to obscure this by calling it something else (b/c of the negative press following the Vanity Fair article about 5yrs ago).  

For years now it seems that numbers have been set at unattainable levels so that most don't make their numbers. This started during the K.T. era (former COO), presumably to cut payout costs, but it has continued after his departure. If I recall, it started after the company announced an across the board raise in base salaries (apparently in response to 'employee feedback about too much compensation being tied to stock'). 

From that point growth targets seemed to get crazy and a lot of good people left. You'd have one good year but 2 bad ones. Mgmt might change quota or revenue recognition rules mid year and there's nothing you can do about it; or worse yet, you may not find out there was a rule change until the end of the fiscal when you're trying to figure out why your attainment number is off. Incentive plans are so complex that you need a PhD to comprehend. Reporting tools are often broken and you may not be able to accurately track progress against goal, so you may get screwed if you have a manager with few scruples or if you have a mgr looking for a sacrificial lamb for the bottom of the stack ranking."

- Hard problems
- Ability to work on products that are used by 1B people","1) Culture. Everyone is giving praise to the ""New Microsoft."" Satya can say all he wants that he's turning the place around and invests in people - but it's not entirely true. You have the same VPs running teams there and they continue to perpetuate favoritism and sexism. There is no safety at Microsoft. You may be okay in a role for a while, until there is a re-org. A new VP comes in and replaces all the leadership with people they know. That job you were waiting around for? Gone. It's given to someone the VP trusts.

Culture is also about how we treat each other. Office politics happen when there is a lack of trust in the workplace. Teams are still competing with the each other for resources. Within teams, managers are playing games to protect their own feature areas and resources. With respect to compensation, it gets worse. While MSFT can say they got rid of the stack rank, it's the same budget for rewards. It's not possible to give everyone a max payout with the budget. This means the VP takes from everyone to give top rewards to a few key performers.

2) If you ever join MSFT, good luck finding your next job. Many recruiters will question your ability to get anything done. There is definitely prejudice against MSFT employees in the valley."

There are some amazing opportunities as well, if you ensure that you're the obvious choice and best fit for those opportunities.  Innovation and unique experiences are welcomed and appreciated in most orgs (though surprisingly frowned upon in others).  I've gained more substantial experience from Microsoft than any other organization I've worked for.  Though there are ups and downs as in any employee-employer relationship, I wouldn't trade the time I've worked at Microsoft for anything.  I feel more optimistic about my future outside of the company because of my accomplishments inside of the company.","Culture, payrate, and benefits can vary from division to division for similar roles, and hard work is often unrewarded and trumped by politics.  To take advantage of some of the best opportunities, relocation (some paid, some unpaid) is often required and modifications to benefits/pay is the norm.  Also, the classic mentality of ""bad managers"" cause disengagement with the organization while great managers keep you motivated to perform at your best and inspired for what the future with Microsoft may hold is very much a part of working at Microsoft.  I've had some managers lie to me and peers and manipulate situations, while others have recognized me with bonuses and top company recognition.  Work life balance is also hit or miss depending on the org that you work in.  My experience is that as long as you sacrifice and overwork yourself to exceed expectations, you ""earn"" your ""balance"" in the work/life arena.  What may be expected from senior management at the top of the company in regards to the organization's values and expectations can be executed completely differently depending on the org and the managers that are above you."

Made lots of friends and connections. 
A wealth of technologies and roles can be yours!
Depending on the group: a good work-life balance.
The company itself appears to be on a good trajectory!","This may sound like ""sour grapes"" due to recently being laid off by them, but here goes. (Note, most of this has to do with the last group I was in. I hope many others find this NOT to be true.)

* No loyalty: After 10+ years, I came in one day and was let go with FIVE days to find a new job internally. HR doesn't even move that fast! It wasn't performance-based (it came as a surprise to my manager, too) and via the black box that is HR I can only speculate why I was let go: politics? ageism? racism? I was too short? randomly? etc...

* Management in some orgs view devs as indistinct work units. ""For project X I need Y people."" Talent, experience, etc. doesn't matter as much anymore; just someone with a pulse that's breathing and knows C#.

* Politics. Sure, most places have it, but my last position was the first time I've seen retributive actions taken by senior management to get rid of less-than-supportive team members (not me).

* Cronyism: I've seen my teammates not get funding for plane travel from his hometown to campus (Redmond) once every 3-6 months and thus traveled via bus. Meanwhile friends of senior management fly home weekly to California. Friends and the ""good ol' boys"" are more important than the business or fairness. Even while I was getting laid off, certain ""good ol' boys"" were still hiring their friends from outside Microsoft.

* Sexism: Our group's leadership were entirely comprised of Indian males. Unfortunately India has a prevalent sexist culture in many places, and this was transferred to our group. I have Indian friends (male and female) who agree with me, so please don't accuse me of being racist. The women in our group were frequently marginalized and one quit after being told to ""shut up and be quiet"" during a meeting. Not wishing to cause waves none of them wanted the bother and hassle of reporting it to HR so they just left.

* Lack of support for remote folks. It's the 21st Century and some entire orgs have a ""no remote"" policy."

Management leadership was strong, but that could also have it's downsides. When sales we're down, you're working harder. Leadership needed to address the vicious cycle of working extra hard from the middle to end of the month to close sales, leading to burnout.

And staff is two faced. They tell you to go to them if you need help, when they secretly report to managers about anything and everything you do. Do not trust anyone here.

Asinine writeups for things they do countless times, such as a manager daily would drop the F bomb multiple times a day and say other bad words as well, when we get written up for an accidental slip up swear.

Manager asked me if she wasn't putting out after I had a conversation with my female friend. If I said this about their husband or wife, I'd be fired instantly. 

Manager would constantly harass me for asking questions when first starting employment, then get angry that I asked questions, just wanted to make sure I did my job correct. (I have aspergers) 

When I confronted the manager who harassed me I was told I'm not thinking growth mindset and It's my job.... it's my job to be harassed because I asked questions? Terrible.

I have two jobs. Working 6 am and Microsoft all the way till 10 pm. They would hold me later at night because they wouldn't have their stuff together and would make people go on overtime when they aren't even suppose to. Very unorganized. So I get 5 hours of sleep because they fail at their jobs? 

Manager also would complain I wasn't following the steps of service... which I did by the book, got a 10/10 review as well as a full attachment item. And they still complain, never would they try and give positive feedback.

When I asked about the feedback problem why they are always negative, they say I can't take constructive criticism. It's always negative, even if you do things right. 

Over 70% of the employees there hate it, and are only there because of the company benifits. Most are looking for a new job.

Manager would make non racial problems into racial problems because of insecurities. 

I was discriminated agaisnt, and even told them of my aspergers before applying to the job. 

One thing that really blows my mind.. they tell you to enforce a no chair policy when sitting near xbox section. When I enforced this policy, the customer was unhappy about it and I was written up for ""talking bad against the customer"" When I never said any word to him. All I did was ask a manager if they needed to be moved to confirm what they told me before. 

This place is a joke, the turnover and employees is a joke, they leave and get fired because this place is run by jokes. Retail management wad the worst here than any other place I worked for."

The current culture from the top-down is the right one, and the focus on building great products over building something for a salesperson to sell is wonderful.  The company is moving towards embracing open source, which is huge.  Under the right management you can be empowered to act on things that matter to you, and that's critical.  The work is interesting, the problems are challenging, and the scale is one where millions of users are affected.  You can have a tremendous impact if you bias towards action, place yourself under good management, and work with engineering as much as possible.","There are still remnants of ""Ballmer's Microsoft"" in places, where people are still acting in old ways.  Some people still don't ""get"" open source, and hate the very idea of it.  Luckily, you can usually ignore them and get your job done anyways.  When you have to do work that doesn't involve engineers, there's a good chance that you'll waste a lot of time talking about something without ever doing anything.

Specifically within the Finance pipe, there seems to be a lot of resistance or friction for movement. I get the sense that folks are waiting for the other shoe to drop, and are holding back from doing any more than they have to, and managing out of fear. 

And in spite of the comms to the contrary, managers are not interested in diverse opinions or the truth. If you don't agree and go along, you will not be here long.

If you're unsure about what you want to work on or want to try something new, Microsoft is a great place for you. Changing teams is very doable.

2) Great place to learn to be a software engineer. I joined right out of college. Engineers at Microsoft are more battle-scarred than those at younger companies.

3) Stability. If you're looking for stability, look no further. Microsoft isn't going anywhere. Even most of those affected by the layoffs found other jobs within Microsoft.","1) Too big and too unfocused. It's too easy to feel like your work isn't significant due to the sheer volume of other stuff going on. A more lean, focused Microsoft would help engineers feel important.

2) Poor matching of college hires to teams. If you're joining right out of college, be very assertive about what you want to work on (that is, if you actually know what you want to work on). They won't put you where you want to be without a fight.

3) Business outlook. Microsoft is doing just fine but is struggling to gain traction in new and emerging markets. Satya's moving things in the right direction but I have doubts that his changes are radical enough. There's also some resistance from those who have been there forever."

First level and second level manager in Microsofts are the root cause of Microsoft moving very slow and not innovating. These managers are rigid (been there for 10+ years, no more technical, don't understand current trends and they are still decision maker). These people still holds huge power and take all shortcuts and easy and quick things to get quick personal gain/growth. This attitude has hurt Microsoft since last 15 years. 
2. Review System is extremely horrible because stack ranking still happens as of 2016. Though they don't communicate to employees, but HR and Manager maintains Stack ranking and probably curve too.

The work is very challenging and there are many different organizations to choose from.  I've been a full time employee for almost 16 years and still love working here.  

Ever since Microsoft got rid of their competitive review, stack-ranking system, a few years ago, it has really improved morale and productivity in my opinion. Instead of focusing how to outshine your peers, the focus is now on a growth mindset and how you leverage other's ideas to help you do a better job. It's about partnership and collaboration.  

Microsoft does preach work-life balance. I think many have achieved a good balance while others struggled.  The key to a good balance is the organizational VP has to buy-in to the concept.","Some people seem overworked and it is usually attributed to their functional organization's leader that doesn't understand how convey the importance of balance.  As with any large corporation you'll have good managers, and bad ones.  The great thing about Microsoft is they continually look for employee feedback and if you have a bad/poor manager, you can anonymously provide constructive feedback which HR and leadership takes seriously.

You will work with incredibly smart people","Reluctance to truly embrace open source tools for development really hurts developer skill sets. For example, instead of moving to tools like Spark, MSFT builds it's own tools. Most of their own internal development doesn't even use products they sell externally, like Azure. The proprietary tools they use will severely hurt you when you are looking for your next job.

The company is huge part 1. The scope of what you will work on will most likely be small features on existing products. This might be OK from a pure C++ coding perspective but it won't allow you to get architecture development experience, learn new tools or if you want to do something innovative with new technologies. 

The company is huge part 2. It's difficult to stand out when there are hundreds of really good engineers in a division. There are few engineering management roles now, most were eliminated.

Culture can be somewhat forced. Small companies usually have a better culture.

Office has implemented a ""Shared Engineering"" model. Software Engineers are supposed to write product code, test and develop the resulting data streams. Realistically you will find few people that can or want to do all three well."

They provide better than average health benefits along with excellent 401k matching and many other benefits that a large organization can provide.  They have impressive resources financially and many smart, capable employees.  I think the pay is generous for the corresponding titles, but I've noticed that many people come from other companies and have accepted lesser positions at MS.  So, they are paid well and highly capable in that lesser position.",It's a large organization and can be slow to react.  Dis-economies of scale are everywhere with cookie cutter tools and resources that don't always make sense across very different business units.   There are some employees who are not productive and they coast and hide in large departments.  There are also some people that have been promoted within the organization mostly because of the length of their tenure and old friends.

- Brilliant jerks are still promoted and given a lot of influence.
- Work/life balance can be terrible depending on the org.
- Proprietary APIs and custom implementations in Azure that provide the same functionality as open source projects.
- The higher up you move in levels / leadership at Microsoft the more political it gets.

The fact that it's located in the suburbs is a big advantage, usually you need to move to a city to work for a good company. They have good benefits, like free transportation system, cheap employee restaurants, good health benefits, good compensation, etc. I really liked that they have private offices in many buildings across the campus, unfortunately they are slowly moving towards open space now.","After my internship I received a full-time offer from Microsoft. As a non-US citizen I needed a H1B visa to work in the US. After I finished my internship I had to wait for around 10 months to finally find out that my petition was not selected in the H1B lottery so there were no options for me to start working in the US in 2016. Microsoft offered me a placement in Canada instead, with a completely new compensation. They also said I would be working remotely with a Redmond team. I didn't really like the perspective of remote work from Canada for around 2 years so eventually I declined the offer. I was really surprised that they couldn't offer a position in Europe where they also have several development centers, eg. Dublin. Another thing I did not like was the fact that it was nearly impossible to get a full-time offer for a different team than the one I interned with. The team seemed rather uninteresting to me and I figured I would get bored there pretty quickly as there probably would not be much opportunity for me to learn. Overall, I enjoyed my time at Microsoft but I really think they should do something about their hiring process for people from outside of US."

I have never witnessed such a dysfunctional teaming situation.  I have been competing with my own managers for bonus etc. as we were the same level.  Makes no sense to me.

The other major con is they are constantly getting rid of people over 50.  (maybe it has to do with the level thing?)  I've seen dozens of very talented, experienced people pushed out and it really looks like age discrimination to me.   Class action suit in the future?  

Finally, i agree with someone else's review about chasing shiny objects.  Doing a great job isn't good enough.  has to be something new and shiny that your Manager/Leadership can wave around to look good.  They prefer show horses to work horses."

Good for someone just entering the workforce, as long as you keep up your skills so you don't become obsolete.

* My team had 6 managers and 12 individual contributors--a 1:2 ratio. Managers had nothing to do except micromanage and then start managing each other's ICs.

* There was too much focus on the bright, shiny object that was an abject failure, and those who actually produced useful things for customers got little credit or support. Plus, we had to work harder to get things done in spite of having to waste our time on the bright, shiny object.

* Microsoft is quietly getting rid of its older workers. With each layoff, even those that are supposedly to ""fix"" the phone division debacle, older workers in other divisions are also laid off. They are often rehired later as a contractor at a substantially reduced rate.

* Management in my division made it very clear that any new hiring or replacements for those who quit would  not be in the US. There is talent in this country, but Microsoft isn't willing to pay for it.

* Because of the internal politics and processes, any real innovation happens due to acquisitions and mergers.

Regardless of the HR rhetoric, there continues to be a forced distribution of rewards / impact, there is a fixed pool of dollars that can be distributed, and the lower side of the rewards scale is a linear one, and the upper rewards side the scale is an exponential one.  Therefore, to give one person high rewards, it requires putting 2-3 people in the lower rewards section.  This is enforced at level bands.

Getting a single zero reward review will end most careers, so it affects how people take risks, help others, etc.

(if you make it to Director in your 30s you have done extremely well).
- You have to take all your 3 weeks of vacation within that year"

-Maker garages on campus for prototyping
-A lot of potential to move around in the company","-Over the last 10 years, it went from more personal feeling to completely robotic, and now something slightly less robotic.  You feel very replaceable.  
-Satya's new culture and values sound great, but feel like they haven't made much inroads in the company.  Ex. We have hackathons now, where we're supposed to get a week off to work on something cool.  Unfortunately, schedules don't account for this, so if you do the hackathon, you still have to meet your deadlines anyway.  Since they already fill you to the brim with work, it's not a real plausible activity.
-Agile, but not really agile.  There's a new agile movement going through the company, which is great!  Unfortunately, leadership seems to still be operating in waterfall mode, so bottoms up planning still needs to be done.
-Not invented here syndrome is really hurting the company's productivity.  Teams are so tied to homegrown mechanisms for shipping it takes forever.  Open source is making inroads, but there will continue to be friction so long as people's reviews are tied to value delivered, and value delivered is usually measured by working software.
-Seattle area housing market is insane.  Most decent homes within a reasonable commuting distance start at $650k+; at current mortgage rates, you need 20% down minimum ($130k in cash), and many home sales come down to bidding wars with buyers paying all in cash or $100k over asking."

AGILE AND PRACTICES.
It's just a fancy word - nobody knows what it is and how to use it. Within one team people say that we do Kanban and daily SCRUM. Some say that Agile means ""no tests"" - that's why they prefer TDD. People just have no idea what they are talking about and don't realize how ignorant they are.
Every person works on it's own project - no team collaboration at all.

TESTING.
""Unit tests? Never heard of."" They just don't know how to write testable code, and I haven't seen any unit test at all - everything just gets deployed to a test environment for testing, and full run of all tests for a product can take 3 days. No need to mention the complete absence of dependency injection.

SOURCE CONTROL AND FLOW.
Source Depot, TFS, no GIT. No branch-per-feature strategy.. That is complete mess - so many times other teams broke the entire codebase..

NO SDET POLICY.
After they removed the SDET role all Senior SDETs became Senior SDEs. Ha ha - good luck with that.

TOOLS AND FRAMEWORKS.
Everything is internally developed at Microsoft, no documentation, just some people know little bit about how their internal crap works. Forget even about MSTests that is integrated to VS - they have another internal testing framework. The build system is horrible - it's designed to handle circular dependencies in projects!!! You are useless with your knowledge of  most used frameworks, component, libraries when you get to MS, and it's opposite when you quit - all their internal crap will stay internal to MS.

MOTIVATION.
Most of people just do their job and don't really care about all of those details. I've spoken to other newcomers - they have similar opinion about working at MS, not exciting at all.

WORK LIFE BALANCE.
Forget about your life, slave. If you are on-call, that means that you need to get up at 3am on Saturday or Sunday and fix the issue, and you get nothing, just nothing for that - no extra vacation, no overpay - just nothing.

Compared to our competition, retail jobs do not pay a lot unless you're in management or working as a teacher. However, they expect you to handle so much crap and juggle multiple duties that other people are being PAID to do. Management at my store was an absolute joke and it's the reason I quit. It was a lot of shady things occurring in our store and favoritism was a huge issue as well. People were not held accountable for their mistakes or lack of work unless management didn't like you.

Your career can excel more by aligning with the right manager and drinking the Kool-Aid with a lot of enthusiasm. Less based on your performance and impact.

10103,Microsoft,Work very hard but do not expect to be rewarded for that,2016-06-11,3.0,Software Engineer II,"I have been working for Microsoft for a couple of years now in different teams. A lot of people say the teams in Microsoft can be drastically different with some teams having a harsh environment while others a much more friendly one. Well, my experience working on different teams was pretty similar, and I can say the same for some of my teammates that worked on different teams as well. 

Some of the pros are:
Fair base salary, large company with lots of opportunities, some smart engineers, good benefits (vacation, parental leave, health care, etc).","When it comes to working environment, Microsoft has evolved a lot in the last couple of years. The evolution was triggered mostly by getting rid of the draconian stack ranking review system where even great engineers could get poor reviews. However, there`s still much to improve before I could say Microsoft has a friendly and truly cooperative environment and a meritocracy based rewards system.

There`s still a lot of politics where the people who rub the managers back the most are the first being rewarded; most engineers there are not really interested in helping each other; rewards are  not based on results and talent, but on politics and the number of years they have been working there.

When it comes to work life balance, some managers push people to work very hard, but when they do so and achieve great results, there`s little to no recognition for that. In some managers mind, working 12-14 hours a day is just expected; other managers might not push you too hard, but don`t expect any recognition from them as well. To be fair, it`s fairly quick to get promotions from lower levels, but from mid to higher levels (62 and up), it becomes very difficult: just results and talent is not enough, politics is required.

When it comes to compensation, the base salary is fair / aligned with the industry, but stocks and bonuses are well below similarly recognized companies, so compensation altogether is 50-150k below companies like Google, Facebook, LinkedIn and even Amazon."

If you are familiar with Microsoft products, working with them will help you take your skills to the next level.  The pay and benefits are also very good.  They reward you if you contribute to the success of the team.  They also provide healthy snacks and have a great cafeteria with discounted food.  Finally, you can get all sorts of Microsoft products for a discounted price.  Overall, it's a very good place to work.","Critical situation calls come in every day.  If you pick one up, you may be able to hand it off at the end of your shift you may not.  So it's hard to make plans for the evenings because you might be stuck on a Critical situation call with no hand off for a while.  I think the longest one I had to wait for was about 4 hours past my normal shift.  If you don't mind that kind of thing, then this may not be a con for you.

The other thing is that they really don't offer training.  You get some time to onboard, but they essentially give you reading material and then put you on calls with customers.  Knowing what I know now I would have used that onboarding time differently.  But there wasn't (at least in my case) much direction.

This is endemic in the tech field and Microsoft is no exception and they do not have any organized way to correct for this gender bias. No good managerial oversight or training so your experience will depend on the manager you get.

Stable job environment. Retention is fairly high and there are a lot of seasoned coworkers.

Company is stable and many product areas to try.

An obvious one, but the status that comes from working for an iconic company.","Not as much room for promotion or growth (at least on the team I was on). People were very competitive, but the vibe was that management expected people to work with both ends of the candle burning as the norm.

While there are many product areas, my impression is that exploring other teams and trying to transfer to another is strongly discouraged. Transfering to a different division is even more of a challenge.

Not much support by management to explore areas of interest in terms of new tools or technologies. This might have been a culture trait of my team.

Lots of redundant menial work that should be automated, but no bandwidth given to work on tools for these. Also a lot of the existing tools were slow or error prone and needed to be improved or redone, but again no bandwidth given for these.

Not great at onboarding new employees in my team (I am not referring to the general NEO done by HR). Lack of training materials and outreach to integrate new FTEs."

Benefits are pretty decent, with the exception of the medical plan, which is a high-deductible HSA type deal. There are small pockets within the company which are still pretty good.","The company is dying. People are disenchanted, unimaginative, and in general just don't care. A lot of things are ""the way they've always been"". Way too much people who have been there for 15-20 years and don't know any better. Terrible fragmentation between teams makes collaboration next to impossible. Unnecessarily rigid scheduling leads to sandbagging and hampers quality. Way too many PMs. People aren't interested in helping you _at all_, moreover, come review time it is not uncommon for backstabbing to break out.

Poor doesn't begin to describe it.  The company has a culture of promoting high performers at an Individual Contributor level, and doing nothing to grow their leadership or management skills.  So you end up with managers that have no experience in managing, and it shows!  In 6 years I've had 4 managers.

It's not perfect, but no company is, but it's still a lot better than most companies I've worked for.  You can work on projects that impact the entire world.  If you don't like what you're current job, you can easily move to another team or division and keep all your seniority and benefits.  (And the benefits are great!)","Microsoft can be a little insular and internally focused, although we try not to be.  Managers aren't uniform, there are good ones and bad ones everywhere, and you can get a bad one at Microsoft.  The environment can be very competitive, it's not for everyone (and getting in can be very competitive too)."
10296,Microsoft,Great company,2016-04-21,5.0,Software Engineer II,"At Microsoft, you have the opportunity to work in many different fields at a very large scale.  Benefits and compensation are competitive, and it's a great location if you aren't interested in living downtown somewhere.  Work-life balance is considered important, so you won't find yourself working 12 hour days.","With the removal of stack ranking, many of the common cons associated with Microsoft have been eliminated.  Most cons have been the result of my particular teams, but Microsoft does use some older technology for engineering which can be cumbersome.  Be careful if you sign up for a ""quality"" role as you may not be getting what you expect."

I believe if you have a solid professional background you will be able to negotiate a good comp package + signing bonus.  Personally, I love to give to charities and truly appreciate the company match up to $15k.  Microsoft provides a good deal of opportunity for growth - if you take it.  Good technology.","I found Microsoft to be too internally focused.  Limited opportunities for promotions for most people.  Many people are in the same level for years with limited promotion.  Calibration still exists, which wouldn't be a CON if it wasn't so subjective.  Basically, if you aren't playing an internally focused game, you will be at risk on your rewards.  Again - one of my PROS is the compensation.  Therefore, while there might be lots of back-stabbing politics to play on the corporate campus, you might still take home a good wallet.

Even the store meetings are fun. And for the first 3 years I was there, it didn't feel like I was just working retail - it felt like I was part of something bigger and a lot better.","We had a change in management at my location and the turnover rate spiked. For a long time, the most common reason employees left was a promotion within the company. But I saw more people leave last summer than I'd seen in the 3 years we'd been open. I can't speak for everyone, but for me, it was depressing to check my work email after a few days off to find out another co-worker was ""no longer with the team"". 

By the time I left, it no longer felt like I was part of something bigger; it was just another retail store with a revolving door of employees. It's hard to feel like you're part of a team when your ""teammates"" change several times a month. 

There were other changes I disliked, but it's difficult to explain those without getting too specific and losing any anonymity Glassdoor may give me.

If I had left a year earlier, this review would be 4 stars and my only complaint would have been the lack of communication among managers. But seeing things change the way the did has left me disappointed."

You don't get any end-to-end responsibilities unless you've been there for 20 years and have finally 'served' enough time to make Corporate Vice President. Even then, there's a ton of pointless politics and absolute lack of regard for how simple the offering should be and how to serve the customer. Half the time, nobody knows what the hell is going on in the organization. The company is so big and bloated that there's so much duplicate work going on, and zero ownership given to young, motivated, smart people.

The lack of agility to respond to market opportunities or simply have a business review that isn't weighted down by process can make the company feel like the post office at times.

They have a massive poll once a year and they really seem to listen to our responses
When you have a good manager, you are set up to do well and advance in pay/responsibilities","Management is a toss-up. In my 5 years with MS I've had 9 managers. 1 was excellent, 2 were decent, 2 were a nightmare, and the rest were forgettable. Of those 9 managers, 6 of them were in a different location, and 4 of them I never even met in person. This makes it really hard come review time.

They have a weird review system where basically a certain percentage of the company has to be let go every year. This makes for a lot of competition, obviously, and also makes it hard to really help or collaborate with teammates, since you're basically doing everything you can to not be that bottom group of people.

They claim that it's easy to move around the company, but I've found that to be very untrue. Once I was hired, I stayed in my role for 2 years, became a subject matter expert, and then tried to move on to the next thing. I wanted to expand my knowledge, keep learning, and try something new. It's been 3 years since I started trying, and I'm still in that same role I started in. And I have great reviews, so you'd think other teams/managers would be interested in me. But the reality is that moving from one team to another is incredibly hard because the way we are trained here makes us incredibly knowledgeable in one small field, and basically clueless in everything else. I wish I had a broader knowledge base. This also makes it hard to find new opportunities outside of the company."

If you complain, you are marked. constant change makes employees fearful and therefore less collaborative, more defensive and feeling as though ""I must succeed at all costs"". Review process has NOT changed. On paper yes, but not in reality. If you make many small impacts the work is dismissed for those who may drive one large project. Evaluations are not focused on holistic impact, peer reviews are selective, and can be excluded. process can be very subjective with no recourse.

If you don't like what you're doing or not performing well, instead of helping you find another opportunity on the same team or on another team, they may ask you to politely resign. Big teams = low employee morale and lack of fun culture. The smaller the team, the better and more close everyone is, as it grows, you can pretty much forget about that connection."

It's also been aggressively innovating now that it's lagged behind in the consumer electronics space. Exciting place to be, and definitely the best company I've worked for. I felt like they definitely took care of me as an employee.","High turnover within the company, at least with younger employees. Many of the people I worked with in the company ended up leaving to pursue other opportunities. Also, work-life balance can sometimes be skewed, and you really need to set boundaries because they will otherwise swallow you whole, if you let them. They weren't so great about letting me work remotely when I had to pick up and move out of the continental US, but I also don't blame them, it was a big change in distance.

So many internal programs focused on diversity and inclusion. I've been fortunate to work within an organization lead by true people-managers that genuinely care about managing people and careers, not accepting a manager position as a selfish career-advancement. People often talk about ""having impact"" as a reason to look for gigs at smaller companies. I'd argue that you have even more opportunity for impact at a company as large as MSFT because of the inherent scope and reach that the company already has - leverage it, don't fear it.","Like many places - there's always more to do. It's fast-paced, demanding, and frugal. As a budget manager and strategist, I always feel like we're asked to do more on less... but that's a healthy exercise for any responsible company to go through on a continuous basis."

If you had the luck to be on a good team with a supportive manager like I was, the sky was the limit to what you could imagine and achieve. You felt empowered to constantly take on more responsibility, learn new skills, promote your ideas, and be compensated and appreciated appropriately. Even today, the people working there are very smart, and some are interesting.  Microsoft treats its employees quite well. The campus is beautiful, the food is good, some people still get private offices, and the charitable match, tuition reimbursement, fitness, free commute and parking, and other benefits are fantastic. Plus you get a lot of prestige, respect, discounts etc. by working for Microsoft.","Anymore, Microsoft cares only for its stockholders and stock price. They will do anything, including cutting as many employees and programs as possible, making their products worse, and mistreating their users, to reduce costs and improve the bottom line. If you are old or female, if you work in content, especially if you have been successful and long-term so your salary is high, you will or probably have been axed. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. They used to hire ""Microsoft material"" and train you as needed, but now they hire whoever can do the job du jour for the cheapest price, then they will kick them to the curb too. No one's job is safe except possibly the upper management layer whose sole concern is to keep their own jobs and fiefdoms. Expect to work with lots of minimum viable products, cancelled projects, reorgs, office moves, and a weird Microsoft jargon that is mostly TLAs. Endless meetings and PowerPoints yet a lack of communication, wasted and duplicated efforts that can go on for years. Also expect your family and friends to constantly complain or seek your help with their Microsoft products, and to realize that a lot of the outside world hates or scorns Microsoft and with good reason."

* Does not have standardized training for Support Services, needs better hiring techniques to filter out unqualified candidates, and needs to streamline the employment initiation post hiring process
* Lacks open cooperation and collaboration between teams - unhealthy competition
* Many Individuals tend to rather put blame on others and refuse ownership or responsibility
* Managers should work closely on setting standards and procedures in writing and sticking to them - much communication about standards and procedures is word of mouth.
* Company needs more focus on the future and bigger picture and to not fall in the loop of old bad habits
* Still a strong presence of ""Always done it this way"" mentality that needs to be filtered out or changed"

Too many ""managers"" who don't do much more than report and babysit. 2. One of the biggest failures of Microsoft is in their annual review process. That makes or breaks your career in the company and you are in competition with your own team! So in order to get the best annual review, you HAVE to step on your colleagues. 3. Poor feedback mechanism. They do NOT take criticism very well, neither internally nor from external customers. I've suggested a more robust feedback tracking mechanism for years. 4. Microsoft ""help"" is most often no help at all. What they should do is link from these ""help"" pages to the blogs page which addresses these topics. More examples, less technical jargon. If  you really want help with anything Microsoft, it's a LOT more productive to Google it than go through help online. 5. The biggest fat to trim is upper management. They create these layers of useless lower managers to pass the buck on to and insulate their positions. Then, to make themselves seem like they're doing something important, they'll ""revamp"" the process in a cyclical fashion. ""Silos good, silos bad, silos good, silos bad...""

Even with a lot of competition (Google, Facebook, etc), it still draws and attracts a lot of intelligent, driven, and ambitious people.","When people transition to new roles, getting off to a bad start with your manager can basically sink your career.

Outsourcing was always a problem but even more so after Satya took over. Walking through the Commons I always at least half H1B types but more recently they are more of a majority. Sent more emails to foreigners than I did to Americans. Understand Microsoft is a corporation that is heavily leaning towards replacement with H1Bs since American engineers are considered too expensive so expect to be treated like a replaceable cog and discarded as such. There is a lot of outsourcing still occurring so if you can get an offer somewhere else, seriously consider leaving if you value your job security."

Satya has brought about a much more modern and open Microsoft than in previous years - fast deployment and standard service practices are the norm nowadays.  The connection with opensource and other industry technologies is very refreshing and creates a lot of opportunity that was not there before.

- Executive leadership willing to change course when necessary
- Azure as a platform is reaching critical mass
- Fast, modern services culture is becoming universal across the company","- Microsoft is still a bubble (as are many larger corporate environments)

10755,Microsoft,"Horrible Experience, Caveat emptor",2016-03-04,1.0,Business Program Manager,"Seattle (Redmond) is a beatiful campus, very easy to find everything closeby.
Commute can be either horrible, if you choose to live in Seattle, or really nice if stay in Redmond, Bellevue etc. Anything from 10 minutes to more than an hour from door to door.

Compensation and benefits were good, even generous.

Plenty of good individuals and talented people. Some even worked as full time staff (FTE) but more as Contractors in my experience.

Had an opportunity to see a really badly done onboarding, benchmark I'm sure to remember and never to repeat. Which in itself is not that hard...

Friday's seemed to be casual ...meaning people either did not come to office or left pretty early. I don't play golf so was mostly working.

Saw an organisation I will never again need to consider for future positions.","Be sure to know the team/organisation you are joining and most importantly find a way to contact someone in the team to figure the daily experience. I was a bit naive to accept my new opportunity without digging little more.

My experience was really bad, absolutely no support available to get started.
Seemed everyone was mainly interested in keeping their own little wheels spinning. After leaving and having little time to reflect I noticed how easy it was to start to get sucked to this world. Luckily got out.

I have hired multiple people in my role as manager and never ever seen this miserable way to bring someone upto speed and get them started to grow in the team. My so called superior was totally uninterested in taking any time to explain or agree my role properly. Advice came in the form of ""don't do that"". No coordination effort in the team, only individuals stepping on each other and a lot of backstabbing and organisational fighting. The picture of different Microsoft departments shooting each other is no joke, it was alive and visible daily. What I heard there are some teams that are better but mine sure wasn't.

HR is a joke and required constant pushing to get anything done. Before joining I was pushing to get issues moving and after starting spend significant time in correcting mistakes. Not sure why HR ""experts"" were assigned, would have been faster in talking directly to people making the work. Again non-FTE people mainly doing good work."

Basically if you're maybe in highschool or starting college this might be a decent job, otherwise I can't recommend it.","Moving up in the company is not easy at all, espically when your manager favors hiring externally instead of promoting internally. There's huge problems with favoritism, and Store Managers work horribly under any type of stress. You're constantly reminded the retail stores aren't making the company any money, and that your employment is almost a gift. Yearly, the entire company structure changes and you're expected to immediately fit into their new mold. While there is zero commission, you're expected to sell like your job depends on it. People with absolutely no experience whom have just started with the company get promoted over people who have worked there for years since tenure isn't looked at for growth. 
Work environment can be fun however a lot of times its extremely childish and ridiculous with constant cheering, clapping, yelling. If you go through their NSO program you'll know all about this. Most of the time you're treated like you're in kindergarden. 
Bonus is based on sales and customer satisfaction survey. However, if your store isn't making huge business sales, your bonus will never amount to anything. Raises are yearly and the absolute most you can make is 4%. Most employees only get 2% raise. It's pretty horrible."

Super micro management, 1 on 1 with your manager every week, 4 x official reviews per year. Manager can make or break your career, manager can rank you at the bottom even you work hard. Ranking system still exist, believe me. Most of the managers been working there over 10 years, no idea how outside world work."

For women, the company offers women's conference annually with great speakers, which is very educational.","In recent years, there have been waves of re-structuring and downsizing. I also want to point out that there are VERY few African American employees at Microsoft. There are many non-white employees because of the large number of Indian and Chinese employees, but in terms of hiring ethnic minorities in the US, there are a lot to be improved."
10843,Microsoft,big slow company,2016-01-28,2.0,User Experience Designer II,Many smart people who really want to do great work. Pockets of really exciting work on various teams. Stable job to just do some work.,"Company has no real vision, mission or values. Antiquated processes and organizational hierarchy. The company moves slower than ALL competitors. We are too afraid of failure so we take no risks.  That's an unsustainable market position even if Office 365 prints money or Exchange is forced down the throats of all the Fortune 500 companies' employees.  Soon enough it will be leap frogged by the next wave small businesses using newer products and processes. There is very little genuine innovation. Too many broken promises Windows 8, Surface, Windows Phone, Zune, Xbox music, Bing, Nokia etc.  We enter markets without passion. It just seems like someone in management said, ""Here's a place we might be able to make some money."" Then we timidly go into the market and kill the project a few years later. The products lack fundamentals, passion and focus because leadership lacked a focus on the fundamentals and genuine passion for the customer's needs.  There is no real feedback loop between putting a product out and seeing if it's successful and iterating.  Usually we take so long to make something that a feedback look is years then people have moved on to other projects and a different team has to pick up the pieces and start over only to make the same mistakes. The worst part is that everyone knows the problems and we're all a bit ashamed of the mistakes and products we released that we weren't proud of.  Management isn't stupid. But somehow nothing ever changes."

There are certainly a diverse set of personalities to deal with but generally if you are not abrasive yourself, you will find yourself immediately part of the engineering community. The shifts in HR policy in recent years have really put Microsoft at the forefront of progressive changes and they do a good job of rewarding top performers.","Satya's new vision for the company is fantastic and the different divisions are taking different approaches to realize it. As can be expected, some divisions are struggling to make the culture change promised by Satya. Few other companies have as many products and features to coordinate for aligning releases and delivering the customer ""pop"" that investors need to see and there is an aversion to taking risks after the Win8 debacle so executive and senior leadership seem to continue relying on old instincts and preconceptions for planning and executing.

Like everyone else they are trying to cut costs but still they were above average in the industry. I moved from Microsft to Google and definitely the medical benefits and most of other are the same. 
- Company is huge so there is a lot of space to find interesting projects in almost any computer science field.
- Company invests in teaching. There is an entire division dedicated to internal education and you can learn a lot if you are driven and plan your time well. You get time off for this so it is not double duty.
- In my experience the people are professional and friendly especially if you are an engineer up to mid-level management (dev leads, dev managers). 
- Ballmer is gone. The new guy Satya seems to know what he is doing. I get this from the many friends I have left at Microsoft and from watching the public moves the company makes. 
- They are stongly poitioned to take advantage of the cloud revolution (Azure is a distant number two after Amazon)","- There is some politics from mid-level up (quite a lot). This affects everybody because it results in teams being realigned, moved around, competing projects etc. 
- Company has the two cash cows struggling. Windows ecosystem (outside cloud) is disappearing and Office has some stiff competition. But they are trying to do the right thing
- Company is still recovering from the huge mishandling of the mobile presence (the Nokia deal, the Windows Phone OS going noewhere, etc.)"

Great health benefits, cool tech perks, and a fun work environment. Tons of opportunities to learn computer competencies and become fluent in Office - skills that help in any future position. Microsoft as a whole has a strong company culture.","Management has changed since I was employed at the Microsoft Store, but at the time there were many empty-promises made (surrounding promotions within the store / company) to top-performing employees. I believe this was done to get people to stick around longer than they would have, otherwise, since Lone Tree is a top-performing store. At times, it felt like 10% of the employees were doing 90% of the work. Things may have changed since then, but I'm not sure."

They are liberal with giving out stock but it usually takes several years to vest, meaning if you leave you lose it.","Like all big companies your bosses primary concern will always be trying to look good to his or her boss rather than trying to make a decision based on their own judgement.  Unfortunately this means they are guessing at what will get them ahead rather than focusing on a good product; so they are only looking upward for leadership rather than downward for feedback.

Now add in six to ten levels of sycophantic guesswork and the result is a bafflingly frustrating experience for an employee and a mediocre product as a result.

Work/life balance is a joke as your boss will definitely say things like, ""Don't work too much"" or ""take care of your health"" then make a random change of direction and give you 80 hours of work that week without compromise."
10879,Microsoft,Losing great people,2016-01-17,3.0,Senior Consultant,"Great people to work with, extremely smart and good pay.","Over the past several years, the field leadership has really become disconnected from the overall MS mission.  MS (MCS) has really become a who you know type business with all the executives/Sr. leadership scratching each others back.  It's about who you know and do as I say, versus the work hard get rewarded of old MS.

The manager completely yanked me around and didn't let me do what I was hired to do. I was penalized for having surgery and for not having system access after my contract was screwed up on three separate occasions.  The lack of dedicated office space makes it nearly impossible to work especially if you happen to have a disability. I worked for 22 hours straight to fix a data issue that I did not cause and because the systems were so bad and was blamed for taking too long. Your employees do not even know how to use the tools that you create. There is a ridiculously high reliance on email instead of using proper tracking tools and you were penalized if you do not give multiple status updates during the day even when there's nothing to report.

If you have other offers, reconsider.","""overall ratings"" only applies to this job. 

If you are career driven, this job should only be accepted as your 1st job. The structure of the organization and reputation makes it very hard to move around the company. Being in operations especially in this organization, the role and the organization does not prepare you for a ""actual Microsoft"" position. Unfortunately, the organization being run by the director does not encourage the company's mantra or principles, which has encouraged to leave the company.

On the plus side, this organization is a staffed organization performing operational tasks dealing with contracts. Many of the employees in this organization are quite seasoned and are not proactive in providing change. If you are a proactive person that likes to challenge the status Quo, this would be the perfect team to join, make changes, create value, and also standout because no one in the organization makes the effort to do so. Very easy job to coast if you are looking for that, however, the operations services leadership team will limit your potential.

11077,Microsoft,Political environment,2015-12-14,2.0,Software Design Engineer,"Benefits are good if you are a full time employee.  

I have had good experiences at Microsoft with understanding groups with helpful team members. 

With a strong manager at the helm of your group who demonstrates good leadership and communicates with you directly - you will walk away with a very good experience at MS.","Political obstacles affect nearly every aspect of what you do at MS.  You will land on one side of the fence when pitted against your own team wrt performance.  Team work is limited by this fact.  If you are on the right side of the performance fence it's a rewarding place to work, if not, you will be micro-managed and won't enjoy what you are doing there.  

Advice:  Be willing to work hard and slightly less smart than you actually are so as to not get a poor review.  Quality doesn't seem to matter as much as ""just getting it done"" does these days as the emphasis has changed recently.  Contributions are evaluated based on results.  Key to getting results is to publicize what achievements that you generated within and outside of your group.  Pick your partners carefully as their failures will be evaluated as your own failures as well.  Sub-responsibilities that cannot be evaluated easily or at all because your boss may not or can not understand the benefit.  Spend as little time on those responsibilities as you can as there is no value to your performance review by spending time on sub-responsibilities you may have inherited or gained familiarity with along the way that are not directly related to your objectives for the current month."

They seem to give some lip service to professional development for their senior managers.","Don't fool yourself, the stack ranking still exists.  Found myself on a leadership team where we put knives in backs, daily.  The culture of this place prohibits any semblance of innovation or creativity.  Just look at their products.  Are you buying them?  I'm not.  This is a vicious place to work where self-preservation trumps teamwork.  On our leadership team, we scrambled to keep up with our competition, and always found ourselves 5 steps behind.  In a company that touts leadership, I found the ""leaders"" I worked with to be followers, merely mouthing the words of someone smarter, who said things months, if not years, before they did.  As much as Microsoft embraces strategy, I found very little strategic vision within its walls.  Microsoft is no longer a monopolistic utility telling its customers how much they are going to spend on their products.  Better companies are finding ways to gain market share by doing guess what?  Providing products and services that customers actually want.  I think of Microsoft as the GM of the 80s.  Still plenty of hubris, not quite smart enough to see that they already lost the race..."

Microsoft generally has good, well-defined process around growing people and promoting them, giving them feedback, etc. It is a great place to start a career.","Lots of layers of management, meetings, status updates, etc. Some people are trying to change the culture, but the gravity is strong. Microsoft is still a big company, and is trying to figure out how to enact new ways of thinking and executing internally. Most people in management have been there for a while, and they do not have incentive to challenge the status quo.  In addition to that, being a remote location, means less options and teams to move to."

Feels like fighting through mud just to get anything done.  Every decision has to go up 6 levels and come back down.   Constant re-orgs and cancelled projects.

Great benefits, 401K, Company Stock etc. Challenging and usually moves at a pace that maintains that without being overwhelming. Company is very open to promoting career goals and letting employees move teams if they desire.","Teams can be slow to react to changes in the business, this can make for some hectic days until staffing catches up. Company has a ""healthy attrition"" standard meaning that managers have to always have a certain number of employees ready to be let go if upper management decides that a team is too large.

Layoffs - they can ruin people's lives. Or, they can be a blessing in disguise. If you were an employee who worked remotely, they dumped you first even if you were a straight A, gave everything, high performer.

There is some respect from non-Microsoft colleagues for Microsoft employees.","Muddled, unaccountable, big middle management.   PFEs have an Account Manager as a person manager, and they work with TAMs and often other Project Managers, Architects, etc. in the course of their work.  I notice that Account Managers are often not only maladroit with respect to Microsoft technology, but technology in general.  And they often are really poor managers.  Microsoft has a 'connect' process that HR instituted to force managers and employees to talk several times a year.  Often, Account Managers view this as a checkbox, and it's symptomatic if their not putting much effort into managing people.   TAMs are supposed to be Technical Account Managers, but often they are neither technical nor managers.  You can't have a grown-up conversation with TAMs, often, because they don't understand the technology.  They are supposed to be bridge between the customer and the technical PFEs, but I have seen a lot of slacker TAMs who actually just make PFEs life more difficult.  And I've heard customers say that they want the good work that PFEs do, but they don't want to pay for the exorbitant associated costs of having to also pay for ADMs, TAMS, etc. etc. Career advancement within various fiefdoms is not based on technical merit or utilization or even how valuable you are to your customer, but based on 'go along to get along' mentality and kissing up to management."

3. You can easily switch teams within Microsoft if you get bored with current work or team. You can work in different technologies.","1. Some MS products are in maintenance mode and if you are stuck in those teams there is not much to learn.
2. Management has lot of old guys with 20+ experience who are not adding much value to the company but are holding top posts.
3. Some products do not have clear future road map and they get shut down before reaching the customers."
11138,Microsoft,Best Place To Work,2015-11-14,5.0,IT Director,"I've worked at Microsoft and in the IT organization for over a decade. Microsoft is truly an amazing place.
* Extremely smart people
* Truly innovative
* Amazing benefits 
* Your work is truly valued
* If your organization and management believe in your long-term potential and your ability to grow and lead, there are leadership development programs (HiPo/High Potential Program, Key Talent, etc.)
* Ability to experience various products, services, organizations etc.
* Things are positively changing under the leadership of Satya Nadella. There is a positive buzz internally, the industry and investors are responding positively. Our stock prices have shot up. We are truly embracing change and newer/innovative products (Hololens, Surface Book etc.) are being released. 
* Under Satya's leadership and new review model, Employees are measured on business impact (reduces unnecessary politics and brown-nosing, and focus is on impact/results), how they leverage the work of others and build on top of others work (reduces duplication of work across teams/organizations, and increases collaboration), and how employees have helped others to be successful (focus changes from individual success to team success).
* Microsoft has done away with the older performance review system (1 - Outstanding ... all the way to 5 - Very poor/no impact). This was a forced curve, meaning people managers had to find employees to fit in each category leading to some unfavorable behavior and culture. The newer model no longer rates employees on the 1-5 scale, and there is no ""calibration"" exercise (forced curve). However, as a manager one still has to 'differentiate' employees based on impact. 
* Satya meets with his directs and product group leaders/engineering leaders weekly/several times a month. He also has frequent employee all-hands where he talks to employees, and everyone in the company has a chance to ask him questions directly. He is well connected with his leadership team, knows what is happening at the top across the company, and he is well connected with employees at the grass-root level. True leader and positively leading the company in the right direction","* Microsoft truly has some amazing products and technologies but we don't always do a good job of telling the story about our products. Our competitors often make a huge deal of features and functionalities that Microsoft products have had in years. Even as a FTE and 10+ years at the company (true blue Microsoftie), I often come across things in our products I didn't know existed. We can do better in that area. To give credit where due though, under the leadership of our (relatively) new EVP Marketing - Chris Capossella, there are truly impactful, meaningful and inspiring advertisements, and marketing strategies that reflect the power and potential of Microsoft products, better than how we have done in the past.
* While Benefits are better than many other companies, it used to be better a few years ago. Medical was ""free"" and Microsoft took care of all the medical expenses. With the changes a few years ago, preventive care is 'free' but employees have a co-pay for all other medical expenses.
* Compared to similar tech companies like Facebook and Google, we don't have ""Free Food"" although ""Free Soda/Juices"" are available in every building.
* Sometimes things may not seem very transparent across management layers and working across teams may sometimes seem complicated. But with the newer One Microsoft philosophy and way of working under Satya's leadership, there is way less politics and way more collaboration, and partnership. 
* Moving across organizations is relatively challenging (eg. moving from IT to Engineering/Product Group); also cross-org movement after a certain level (Level 65) is challenging. If you want to experience different orgs, move while still a L63 or 64. 
* Likewise L65 and above is a shark-tank."

Management often talks about making changes that have been strongly desired by our customers, just to ultimately turn their back on the change. This directly contradicts the 'Customer Obsession' that is so widely talked about at Microsoft, and points to a far more profound revenue obsession.

good comp, at least in the silicon valley.","microsoft decided to cut the lead role last year and turned all leads back to ICs. what used to happen normally in a 20-30 people team was that there are 3-4 leads for several well-defined and non-overlapping areas with 3-5 people underneath each, and maybe a few principal ICs reporting to the dev manager since they are too senior to report to the leads. 

upper management decided to cut the lead layer for whatever reason. now as far as I can tell there is no single person that's happier.
1. (ex-)leads: obvious. they got demoted. no paycut but hey, who likes being demoted? lots of people left immediately, many ex-leads are still leaving.
2. ICs: little/no sense of focus or attachment for junior ICs. out of collage newhires are simply lost. since leads only had small teams they used to have quite a lot of time for the new guys. now your manager has 20+ reports and runs from one meeting to another. and honestly there is little/no seniorIC-to-juniorIC mentorship unless you happen to go to a team with good people. there is nothing at microsoft that rewards mentoring juniors.
3. managers: they used to have 3-4 leads and plus a few principal ICs reporting to them. now 20+ direct reports. no time to do 1-on-1's and every single thing from the most important to the least escalates to you. 
4. lack of management track: lead position was a stepping stone for becoming a manager later on. now it's gone and there is no track for ICs that want to see themselves managing a team in X years. if you're at microsoft ask this to your manager: ""what should I do today if I want to become a manager in X years"". They won't have any answer. because there is none. No management track whatsoever. the chances you'll be managing a team is equal to somebody in the management chain leaving. and even if you would call that a management track (I wouldn't) that's the worst management track imaginable. think about it. One day you're an IC. next day you have 20+ people reporting to you."

Great health plan options with contributions to an HSA/FSA, $0.50 on the dollar matching on 401K, health and fitness benefits, etc.","I ultimately left the company for multiple reasons, and they all had to do with poor management.  I had 5 managers in 2 years.  The job I was hired for was reorg'd away between the time I was hired and my first day of work.  The job I was given when I arrived lasted 6 months before my team was reorg'd and moved under a different manager doing completely different work.  That job was reorg'd away another 6 months later.  Most managers did little help their people improve, often didn't do anything to leverage people's strengths, and were many times afraid to be forthright about performance.  Although the rating system changed in the past year and a half, the results aren't much different.  People still get stack ranked, and those on the bottom are put in a position where moving within Microsoft is next to impossible (requires VP sign-off from both the losing and gaining org), so their only option is to leave.  I saw several good people leave the company as a result."

However with all the major re-orging that has taken place the infighting has certainly reduced but still there. Microsoft is an older tech company and it shows. a lot of things are still very politically driven and there are still very strong hierarchical barriers. Ideas still mostly come from the top down.

11265,Microsoft,Can be amazing or awful,2015-11-09,4.0,Senior PM Manager,"- Many brilliant people
- Incredibly broad product range - if it's tech and you're interested in it, Microsoft works on it
- Opportunities for synergy - when different product lines work well together, amazing things can result.
- Growth-oriented culture: the company (mostly) knows it's behind and needs to do better, and there is a great openness to change and feedback.
- Benefits: all sorts of great benefits, from very good health care to free gym membership to bicycle commuter reimbursement, they take care of you pretty much any way they can think of (except no free food, which apparently is due to the lack of cafeteria space).
- Giving campaign: Microsoft gives the most money per capita to charity of any company. And no, Bill Gates doesn't count towards that :).
- Satya Nadella appears to be a good CEO. He is open to innovation, to change, in a way that Ballmer wasn't, and he's generated a lot of positive sentiment around the company.
- Pay is competitive. Others may pay somewhat more but it's all enough that pay isn't the deciding factor.
- Flexible hours, decent work-life balance in most groups","- Bureaucracy: the company still feels big, old, and heavy. Everything needs a million approvals, and people get back to you slowly.
- Are we going to make it? The company is way behind in many markets and may not come back. There is enough cash in the bank to last forever, but there will be a point of no return well before the money runs out.
- Some products *suck*, and you're expected to use them anyway. It's also really embarrassing and demoralizing to make crappy products. 
- ""Kool aid"": many people internally seem to think our products are much better than they are. There is a vocal feedback culture telling them the products suck, but some teams aren't listening. This can be extremely frustrating.
- Management is inconsistent. Many divisions and individual managers are excellent, but there are also giant pockets of rottenness, ranging from HR-type problems to poor feedback to over-focusing on short-term results to simple poor decision making. If you're coming to work here, make sure your manager is solid. Of the orgs I'm familiar with, I would recommend the C+E organization (Azure) and disrecommend Microsoft IT (highly political).
- Slow to promote/give raises, causing many good employees to bounce to competitors for a while, then back, in order to get their fair market wage.
- There are a bunch of old-timers who still don't get it and act like it's 2002 and we own the world. They aren't doing well and are slowly getting pushed out, but they're still around annoying the rest of us."

Lots of layoffs since joining (over 7,000 people from the Nokia acquisition, hundreds of others from Xbox, Surface Hub, etc.). People don't seem driven and put in minimal effort/hours. Many are just cruising with their high-pay, low-stress jobs and focusing their time on things outside of work. Have to use Microsoft technologies to get all your work done (Outlook/Sharepoint/OneDrive), none of which work well because they push the internal buggy versions to everyone's machines. No real ""company culture"" that I can identify with. The company is focused way more on software and the hardware engineering operations are kind of a joke.

Personally: project was canceled within three months of taking the job. The job I negotiated for was also not what I was placed into and management didn't seem to care. Ended up being a big step down on a technical level. There's an overall lack of any real challenge and, for most of my time here, a lack of any real work to do at all. Team was not prepared for my arrival -- couldn't log into computers, couldn't access emails, had no badge/couldn't access the building for four weeks and had to call coworkers to let me in after using the bathroom.

There were lots of nice little perks like free snacks in addition to the company-wide free drinks, social events with food an beer, and occasionally meals were provided. Free parking is also a plus, even if it can be tough to find a spot on Microsoft Campus.

The job itself was a great experience for me and I was allowed to be self driven. After learning the ropes I generally worked on my own, but if I needed help or didn't have the solution to a problem everyone on the team was more than happy to help. Overall it was a very positive environment. I especially enjoyed being able to work directly with people in the production and design teams, which made it easier when trying to understanding intended functionality of the product.","I was a contractor, which meant that I had far less job security and a rather sad excuse for benefits. No vacation pay, no sick pay, and the health benefits were a joke. I may have had a better impression of the overall experience if I hadn't been quite unceremoniously booted out the door with no two weeks of notice.

Normally Microsoft has a general policy for contractors to work a certain amount of time before needing to take a 6 month hiatus before being allowed to return to the company. The contractors on this project however became assimilated into a greater part of the studio through some unclear and confusing policy which, we were told, meant an indefinite employment for ""at least 3 years"" and plenty of job opportunities to advance their career and even become FTE with Microsoft.

Instead this turned out to be a bunch of bloated nonsense and after realizing that their budget was overblown, several people were quickly let go with no prior warnings."

11358,Microsoft,"Good company, but avoid Bing Ads",2015-10-19,2.0,Program Manager,"- Salary and benefits are superb.
- Lots of support for self-directed growth - they'll reimburse up to $6,000 of college tuition for any classes in any field, and you're encouraged to seek out projects or roles that specifically interest you.
- <i>Everyone</i> you work with is smart and very motivated. This isn't just the engineering department - tech support, UX design, business strategy, etc. are all staffed by people very good at their jobs.
- The Online Services Division is very diverse. About 90% of our employees were born overseas, in countries ranging from Nigeria to Russia, and people are very open and curious about different cultures. I'm a woman, and I've never felt the management or my team treated me differently or respected me less. I did get some dubious comments from two of our developers (out of 40+ developers I've worked with), but those specific people have a reputation for being abrasive with everyone.","Note: Microsoft is <b>huge</b>, each department has its own culture and pros & cons, so a lot of the complaints below are specific to the Online Service Division or Bing Ads.

- Management styles in Bing Ads are harsh to the point of being unrealistic. The leadership team is certainly competent, and we've made major improvements to both our product and business strategy since I started. However, they're prone to setting unrealistic deadlines and punishing people for failure regardless of whether that person had any control over the source of the delay. It's very difficult to ask for clarification of goals or explain why it's infeasible to implement the plan in the time allotted, because the manager will often dismiss the problem and imply you're stupid for asking. Their overall attitude is 'Make it work, or we'll find someone who will.'

- MSFT's code base and bureaucracy are both huge and old (by tech industry standards). I recently wanted to change the text of a few links on one of our websites. It took three months to a.) identify the dev lead who owned the code (because ownership changed three times in three months), b.) identify the developer with access permissions to deploy the changes, and c.) get the new text approved by our cloud of business groups. In another case, it took a month to figure out which person had the authority to approve emails to customers. Both the people and the process needed for any given task change every 1-2 years, and the documentation is rarely updated completely or quickly. To be fair, the company has gotten much better about this in the last few years, but PMs still spend half their time tracking down the right person/system.

- Engineering attracts a very distinctive personality type. Whenever you make a mistake, which will be often during the first several months due to the sheer amount of new information to process, people will point it out very bluntly. You can also expect to debate the details of essentially every decision. 

- There's an implicit assumption that if you're unhappy or can't met the goals set for you, you're just not smart/hard-working enough to make it at Microsoft. This creates an Emperor's new clothes situation where problems don't get fixed because everyone's afraid to report them."

Company needs a blood transfusion here are my 2cents 
1) Fire all of your Partner XX (PTS , PAM, ...) they are not doing anything 
2) Change v- to FTE this is not 1800 - leanrn from civil movement- your name is no longer good on resume as most companies resent you - you are equal to wallmart ! 
3) Stop buying technologies you were not able to expand and stop killing them - I mean mobile and phone business - side kick - Nokia ! come on you know you cant do this 
4) Stop copy cating small open source companies - you have already lost the boat - too late too little so dont mess with IoT and Raspberry pi and Arduino and Adafruit - no matter how many times ou print their logo and beg you will never be an Open source company 
5) Hire smart people not snobs 
6) Provide value - what is the WPC (world partner conference ?!) why on earth they should pay $2500 + to attend a measly marketing event to watch how you fixed your last bugs

I witnessed several long term staff (one with 18 years of tenure) get sent packing with nothing but a boot print on their rears.  No package/severance at all.  These were not weak performers...you don't make it 8, 12, 18 years at MSFT being a weak performer.  There is forced attrition and once you are on the list, you are not getting off.
The bonuses for Utilization and CPE (Customer Partner Experience) have been manipulated by HR again this year.  The numbers are now tied directly to a team number.  Does not matter how good you are...if you have a slacker on your team you pay the price.

Benefits are good and lots of flexibility on schedule.","The managers tend to be bad. Don't know any other way to put it. The senior management has no clue the lower managers are so awful so it never gets addresses, or they know and don't care. Not all managers are bad, but I would say at least 65% are really not quality managers but Microsoft will promote them up the rank which makes me think they may be encouraging the bad behavior. Let me give you and example...Female/married coworker had a manager making inappropriate inquires into her personal life via another manager. Instead of that manager shutting him down he gave him the information and then told her he was asking about it."

Highly-vertical / silo company (like 6 separate companies within a company). Redundancies in roles/responsibilities with legacy culture that has not learned how to leverage end-to-end cross-functional value. The good news, new leadership is fully aware and is driving company horizontally (to align with end-customer) vs. product. It's a painful process that will take time."

- Plenty of opportunities to learn on the job.
- Easy to move between groups when one needs a change.
- Easy to find groups doing the types of work one is looking for, since the company is involved in many different areas across the industry.
- The current annual review system is much improved over the past 15+ years' Ballmer-era system & its variations, at least with respect to one's performance rating.","- The compensation side of the current annual review system still needs refinement. Compensation ratings are relative vs. peers -- which is arguably necessary, given budget realities -- but divisions vary in how they allocate rewards across the rating spread, and the results are not always fair to all involved."

Terrific company giving program. Clarity and transparency about the path toward advancement, though that path is very long.","Bureaucratic. Example: if you need to purchase non-Microsoft software to do your job, the process can take 6 weeks. Generally you will feel as though none of your ideas actually get shipped and that can make your work feel meaningless. Overall company culture is insulated from the rest of the technology sector and still living in the 90s. Example: employees attacking other employees on Yammer for owning iPhones (instead of Windows Phones). The path to advancing and becoming a manager is incredibly long. It seems like it would be faster to leave, advance to a management position elsewhere, then come back and leverage a higher position that way."

The art teams, Vehicle Art in particular, were amazing people to work with and made coming into work everyday enjoyable. The studio had a somewhat decent cafeteria, free soft drinks/coffee/tee and if you had to work late or on weekends they brought in food.","As an artist you would expect to be making great art. That's not the case at Turn 10. All the fun content creation is outsourced to India and Vietnam. At Turn 10 the artist basically polish and refine the assets that the vendors return. It's often tedious and boring work. On occasion you would have to model or texture something that was missed or incorrect but most of the time you were just touching up something.
The other problem with working at Turn 10 and Microsoft in general is they don't tend to hire full time. It's contracts only. If you're good and the team likes you there's a good chance they will hire you back for another contract but if stability is what you're after stay away from Microsoft/Turn 10. Also, you don't actually work for Microsoft you work for an outsource agency that hires you out to Microsoft. This way Microsoft doesn't have to pay you benefits or profit sharing. You can get benefits from your agency but probably not as good as Microsoft gives to its actual employees."

1. You're as worthy of moving up as you are dedicated. 
2. You aren't going to be spoon fed opportunities to grow-- seek and you shall find.
3. Room to network and make your name out there.
4. The company actually listens to what Retail is saying and they grow with their employees.
5. They have, honestly, the /best/ coaching and constructive criticism training. I used to be an ASM at another retail company and I was honestly moved by how graceful managers are when it comes to attending to a problem and setting you up for success.
6. The pay is substantially more than other companies-- but be forewarned, with greater pay it comes with greater responsibility.","1. Everyone is working hard to better themselves, which means whether you work as a team or not, your impact is heavily weighed. You are constantly being evaluated and expected to grow as an employee-- and sometimes when you're hired from the outside and not thoroughly trained like in-sourced hires, you can feel like you're at a disadvantage or expected to know things that you haven't been trained for. This is not a job for those who are entry-level to the retail industry or the workforce in general. 
2. Work/Life balance constraints: MSFT goes out of its way to make sure everyone is being worked at the  minimum standard of 20 hours p. week (part-timers) which means that if you're going to school full time, working another job, or just have personal obligations, you need to be prepared to: A) Get two days off a week that will not be consecutive and B) Know your personal life 3 weeks in advance so you can request time off. For school this is especially difficult, because there are always opportunities outside of the classroom for E.C or even graded requirements. They can only be so lenient, and this is always going to be determined by 1) how good you are as an employee and 2) everyone else's availability."

I have a sense of accomplishment knowing I was hired because all of Microsoft's H1-B workers couldn't do the job I'm doing.    People are polite, even if they tend to be somewhat passive aggressive in the way people from Redmond, Bellevue, WA can be.  And that's kind of where the pros stop.  

The only other bright side so far -  I won't be here longer than five years I'm sure.  Which is good, because in IT, anyone who has been at Microsoft more than five years is ""damaged goods"" on the job market.","I'm a W-2 worker at Microsoft (via a staffing firm), and a U.S. citizen.    My pay is $0 because I have yet to receive a paycheck three weeks after my start date.

Imagine starting a job where:
a. your pay rate is variable, even optional at the discretion of the employer ... even after you've done the work.
b. you don't know when your first paycheck will come, or even if your hours of work have been approved.
c. The company doesn't think you're important enough to issue you a security badge on day 1.  So, your start date (and pay) is delayed, and no assurances are given as to when that badge will be issued.  Beg your new co-workers (or the intern) to let you in the office every day in the meantime. Observe that you are part of a scheme where your co-workers' frustration increases because of your lack of badge.  You're helping reaffirm company dysfunction.  Be patient when people seem frustrated at you on some level for just being there.
d. the position you just took was cut from 18 months down to four - even before you started.
e. You'll also learn about all the jobs you applied for and passed over so Microsoft could give it to some H1-B worker (some of them management positions).

If you can imagine that ... then you can imagine what it's like to start work at Microsoft.

Details follow ...

The only kind of work I was offered was a W-2 position with an employment agreement that says pay rate can change to any amount (or be eliminated) at the discretion of the employer.  The recruiter said the position was 18 months.  I later found out it was 4.  More than two weeks after being hired and I still haven't gotten get my access badge for my building.  Payroll setup hasn't been happening either.


It's enough to make ANY person feel as though they are not valued at all.  It's also a way for a company to tell an employee:

Bureaucracy had gotten worse prior to the shakeup in summer of '14. Hopefully it has been streamlined since.

11743,Microsoft,Executive Business Administrator,2015-08-24,3.0,Executive Business Administrator,"• Work/Life balance can be great if you set and stick to your boundaries (more on that in the 'cons' section).

• Casual workplace, no dress code, free drinks, most of the people I've worked with over the years will be lifelong friends.

• Flexibility - have a dentist appointment? No problem. You can hop online later from home to see what you missed, or decide beforehand of you wont be available after your appointment, just let people know.

• Benefits. As in medical, ""perks"", etc - can't beat 'em!

•Name dropping... ""Yeah I work for a little company called Microsoft, maybe you've heard of it?"" Everyone knows that name, that brand. Whether the other person thinks highly or poorly of Microsoft, they know your company. In any country, anywhere. That's pretty cool.","•Set your boundaries on DAY 1. I don't mean the day you start, I mean DAY 1, in the interview loop. It depends on the manager and the team, but unless you want to work 24/7, you better tell them you value your work/life balance and that you don't check mail outside of business hours (of course there are exceptions). Most importantly, STICK TO THOSE BOUNDARIES when you've accepted the offer letter, and you're in the position. One reply from you on a Saturday or Sunday, means they'll always expect a weekend response. The same goes for vacation. Unless there is an emergency, vacation is to get AWAY from work. Do not respond to your email on vacation, or the cycle will continue.

• Any support (admin) position, no matter what company or team, depends on the relationship between the admin and the manager. When your manager is laid off - the person who interviewed you, offered you the job, the person you MUTUALLY chose to work with, the person you've bonded with, built a strong relationship with, automatically know you both have each other's support - is gone. Unfortunately, there are plenty of other managers in the group that they'll shove you under. To be moved to a completely new manager, unwillingly (on both sides) has happened to me several times. At the time, if you hadn't been in a position for a year, you had to request permission from your manager to interview (they've recently gotten rid of that rule, but not in time for me to be laid off). If you decided to request permission, that automatically put a target on your back - so I was stuck until I was finally laid off.

•The pay for admins is lower than most companies, but the benefits do help take the sting out of that.

•Admins are always last on the list for raises. Yes, if you have a good review, you will get a raise. But it won't be very much.

•Yes, you'll work your butt off, some weeks will be crazy and other weeks you'll be twiddling your thumbs. Admin positions are hourly at Microsoft, which is actually an advantage because they get paid OT (time+1/2). However, during the ""slow weeks"", you shouldn't be penalized on your paycheck because there wasn't 40 hours worth of work to do. If your boss says ""why don't you go ahead and take the afternoon off, it's dead"", I'd take the afternoon off! If I needed the full 40 due to financial reasons, I'd make up things to do. That's a waste of my time and the company doesn't benefit either.

•There's definitely been a climate change since Satya took over. The Gates days were the good ol' days, the Ballmer days weren't as great, but still good - I don't have the confidence in Satya to lead Microsoft to success. We used to be and could be again, the best of the best! But I've seen Satya makes one bad decision after another, after another...

• Every team is on pins and needles wondering who will be next on the chopping block. Morale is the lowest I've ever seen it. Something needs to change and revive what we used to be - Microsoft - a company I was always proud to say I worked for. Until now.

•Due to the ""climate change"", you have to look out for you. You'll be back stabbed, stepped on, thrown under the bus. Especially if you're better at your job that the other admins on the team - then you're a threat to them. For the most part, admins used to stick together, now it's eat or be eaten.

•Trust no one. Anything you say will be used against you, if it will take the pressure off of someone else."

If you are the creative types that like to leverage people's idea to be successful and believe the success of the group equals the success of individual no matter what it takes, you will now find MS a place that actually measure your performance in similar ways. Also If you are the experimental kind that thinks that good business in tech needs to move fast with ideas, you will also find that MS is now a place that wants you to help it move in that direction (surprisingly enough)","The flip side of the coin I guess is that you are now needing to learn new ways (ironically ... that's actually how the rest of the industries have been doing things for a while) that is different from the Microsoft that most people use to know. If you are just looking for a nine to five job, you may find you have less and less room to go in Microsoft - there are still places for that, but far less common IMO."

Very good (used to be excellent) health care plan.

The founders (specially Steve Ballmer and Bill Gates) were bad role models and they heavily influenced all leadership under them. It will take 1-2 decades since both retired to decontaminate the company from the negative influence they had in leadership.
The best picture I have seen that describes the  work environment is the one where the individual points a gun to all other individuals that he needs to interact at work.
Projects are terribly bad planned by the top leadership and more than 50% of them are cancelled before completion. Don't fool yourself thinking that this is due to innovation and experimentation; it is simply due to bad planning.
Company acquisition is insane. Billions of dollars are spent buying companies that are quickly destroyed by not letting the acquired company work the way they know. 
Egos fly super high (again, influence from the founders) and most top leadership don't hesitate to put their own career interests above the company's interests. This means, hide what is failing, present and sell what you didn't do but later tell it is ""work in progress"" if confronted with the truth, etc.
Above all, if you are a software developer, you will be working with technologies that the market doesn't want to use anymore. So if you work there for a few years you end up with a unappealing resume when you try to leave the company."

Stock ownership for all employees from day one. Great earnings potential. Fantastic facilities with 5 star dining and free vending machines in break rooms. Very professional atmosphere with high quality coworkers.,"Management style. Microsoft has a management style that I felt discouraged top performance. High priority is placed on sales forecasting to the point that I spent 65% of my time each week in forecast spread sheets and forecast reviews with management. The culture set by management is also a throw each other under the bus culture. Typically sales were performed by sales teams of various Product Specialist Technical Sales Experts and Account Managers. If a team lost a sale to a competitor, management would schedule a conference call with the team for a loss review. During the call the manager would often ask each member of the team who the weak link on the team is that caused the team to loose the opportunity. The legacy Microsoft employees would immediately begin throwing each other under the bus. Having come from an IBM culture where we truly worked as a team, watched each others back and typically had ""air cover"" followed up by coaching from our managers, I found the Microsoft throw each other under the bus mentality to be very detrimental to to building a good close cohesive sales team where the members were motivated to trust each other and work together in a positive way to be successful. It appeared that back stabbing was expected and eagerly applied by employees in an effort to safe themselves or try to get brownie points. I found it to be a very negative and demoralizing approach to team sales.."

I have been both a contractor/vendor and a full-time direct employee. Microsoft used to be an awesome company with vision, great products, and they treated people with respect, dignity, and overall fostered a very healthy work environment.","Where do I begin?
1.) They drag their feet when hiring you (could literally take 5 weeks for them to get through all their corporate nightmare processes (see next point), but are quick to fire and lay off people (I wasn't fired or laid off but just saying)
2.) Overrun by corporate processes and clutter. Everything is more complicated than it should be by 6 or 7 levels. This is showing in the marketplace too
3.) A lot of ancient arrogance. There are still zombies within the company that have worked here 10+ years who think they know better than everyone and this is hurting Microsoft in the long run. Good example: Windows Phone.
4.) They have a clear and distinct ""first and second class citizen"" system. As a full-time employee, you're considered a first-class citizen. As a contingent staff (contractor/vendor) you're considered as disposable as a styrofoam cup. But wait, it gets worse. Not only is this true, they make it a point, on a constant basis, to remind you that you're dirt and you will be tossed to the curb at any time. No I'm not exaggerating! 5.) There is a constant sense of ""everything needs to be done yesterday"" everywhere. So you could pump up really good work, and the response would be like ""That's great, you should have done all of this 3 weeks ago. You're already behind"". Once in a while from a crappy boss here and there I can understand. But this is pretty much everywhere."

- good compensation benefits (until idiots who dialed 911 just for a simple scratch forced MS into introducing co-payments for benefits).","- idiot managers. there are still lots of living FOSSILS who are in management positions just because they've been there for 10+ years. All my last manager was doing is still trying to write a powerpoint presentation from time to time, organize weekly meetings, and (most irritating) reminding me to mark my time off whenever I was out. I asked her what to do when I debug stuff until midnight and she didn't know what to tell me.
MS could fire half of its managers and there would not be a difference in engineering process/deliverables.
- ""russian rullette"" people mention online - you really don't know when you will be fired. Yes, you don't know WHEN, because they fire in such a way so that a pattern can not be established.
- the ""curve"". Not sure if it's still there, but having to find 5% of people to fire based on performance was a bit bad, given the strive to only hire the best. The result was dumber new hires than the people fired.

- You will get good resources, unlike in startups, or medium-size companies. The company does have resources, and if you land in the lucky areas in which it is investing heavily, no expense will be spared.
- Total compensation package is still good. You can definitely get more money at some other competitors, but rarely a total compensation package that is guaranteed. Don’t be fooled by that lucky guy who left at the right time many years ago: for each of those, there are dozens of others who left and are back at Microsoft after burning their savings.","- Lots of high-level managers no longer get anything about tech. They just prepare and present slides, with lots of help, and forward messages. You need to ignore upper management and still execute correctly, while giving credit to them in long congratulation messages at the end of the tasks, so they forget what they told you to do and think the implemented ideas came from them!
- Microsoft can cash current cows for a little while. Because of this, you will see groups of longtime friends in key positions, even when those are related to innovation, just trying to repeat circa 2015 what they did 10 or 15 years ago.
- Coming from a recent ""non-calibration"" meeting in which we were supposed to discuss impact: pure BS.

This roll keeps you busy all day, creating reports and filing them. There are many Administrative duties that need to be completed for audit and are constantly interrupted by store sales. 
Lack of team support creates a struggle to maintain employee moral and ethics. 

Microsoft as a Company has many great and solid future proof ideas with poor plans of execution. There is almost no plan or road map to success. Only a number goal and a time line, that create a constant struggle to perform on a daily bases; because of the lack of knowledge of the 'whys' and 'hows' there is high rate of failure. 'The Own It' program adds or often times triples the goal expectations creating an unbalanced depiction of the companies success. I can go on and on about business and employee success strategy failing over and over again.

12284,Microsoft,Reflecting on a decade,2015-06-17,4.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Foundation - Microsoft is a great place to learn and to explore.  Sure, the first year of employment, you'll be trying to figure out our process around planning, developing, testing, code reviews, checking in code, opening bugs, tracking bugs to builds, build process, talking to others in a 'diplomatic' manner but you'll learn how software is delivered and be able to articulate it.  Microsoft is good at formalizing workflows which is good if you've never worked with a large team.  You'll think of things from security, efficiency, even variable and method names (for public APIs), they have a team dedicate to reviewing and teaching you.

Structure - If you're a fan of process and structure, there's a lot.  Some people hate it, but if you ask ""why?"" instead of complain, you'll often see a reason and if not, you can always find ways to improve it.

Movement - Microsoft is huge and work on many things.  The benefit of being able to transfer teams to learn new things is amazing.  I started working at Microsoft on the front end of some silly application that no longer exists, a year later, I was working on the kernel drivers of their embedded platform.

Security - You'll always be able to pay your bills.  There's only ever been one layoff in my 9 years at Microsoft that has shocked me.  Benefits are spectacular.

Flexible - as structured as the process goes, managers are always willing to be flexible on hours.  It's great for life balance as the demand of life outside of work changes - new parents, family health issues.  When my child was born I would be out at 4:30 and work remotely after my kid was in bed.

Every team at Microsoft varies on the structure and culture, something will usually fit you.","External Movement - back in the early 2000s, having Microsoft on your resume would open doors.  While it's still relatively true (recruiters from FB, GOOG, AMZN will always try to recruit you) getting into smaller companies is hard.  I had a few interviews that had a clear bias towards my experience because Microsoft was seen to be ""old school"" in their software development practices.

The Lifers - Sensitive topic, but there are some folks who basically understand the security of their job at Microsoft [see pro].  There are several people who are waiting for retirement and are working 10 am - 4pm hours.  This is hard because they tend to resist any change or are non-responsive if you email them at 4:01 PM.  It's hard to feel everyone has a shared passion for what they're working on.

The ball drop - Ultimately, somebody down the chain drops the ball.  A project with a ton of passionate engineers delivers but the hardware team drops the ball and creates garbage.  Or a perfect device but marketing creates these commercials that look like something my 3 year old made.  Or a great platform with no ecosystem because the developer tools are hard to use.

The rat race - at some point in my 9 years, I subscribed to the idea of 'get promoted, otherwise I'm not growing!'  Because the entire pay grade and responsibility is tied to your level, it's somewhat true, but when people start working the system, they are merely trying to get promotions (visible projects, taking on responsibilities at the next level) and not deliver solid work at their current level.  I've seen projects where senior engineers were off trying to find things to get them to principle while they let their SDEs and SDE 2's architect the project.  The code was a mess and I was surprised it didn't deadlock more often, but these are things that could have been fixed if their seniors architected the project instead of making them do the cross-team integration work.  Not great if those engineers want to code but are being forced into PM-ish sort of roles.  It's easy to get sucked into the need of perpetual promotions."

12294,Microsoft,Terrible Company,2015-06-10,5.0,,A job with stable environment.,Too many good things. Nothing bad.
12295,Microsoft,"The ""New"" Microsoft under Satya",2015-07-08,1.0,Senior Product Manager,The benefits with the exception of the health insurance are good.  The health insurance in the worst in the industry from what used to be the best.  Salary is decent,"Health Insurance:  This benefit went from having zero premiums, zero co-pay and zero deductible to having a $3700 deductible for a family plan and then after paying 20%.  Then to make matters worst they have added a very complicated and administrative intensive HSA to manage all of this.  Your wife will not have access as it is tied to your corp account so you will have to manage it if you are used to your wife managing these types of things

Expectations:  The unspoken expectation is that you change jobs every 3 years or you are viewed as being dead weight.   It is exhausting.  So if you find a job you love and you are really really good at, you simply have to leave.  Could this be the reasons our products keep getting worse?  Because the people who know them have to leave whether they want to or not?

Stack Ranking:  Do not believe the hype.  This still exists.  They just call it something else and it is more secretive

Review System:  Instead of 2 reviews per year there are a minimum of 4  But they are called Connects now.  You only get compensation for one. So they made something that was already a hassle and made it a double hassle.  Everything you do has to have an immediate business impact.  So if you have a long term strategy or even short term, say a year, nothing you do towards achieving that goal counts because it does not have immediate ""business impact"".   This all started under Satya

Middle Managers:  When Satya came onboard there was all this talk of getting rid of layers of middle management so the real ideas could get to the people who needed to hear them.  This never happened.  Every layoff or RIF, Middle Mgrs. were not impacted and well known technical resources were let go.  This is a  company that values non-technical business school managers more than technical people.  Very different than when I started and the reverse was true

Promotions:   You do not get promoted to a new job.  You only get promoted within your current job.  Being promoted is actually a negative within MS.  For example,  If your job level ranges from 50-52 (fictitious levels).   Say you got promoted mid year from a 50 to a 51.  You think great I am doing a good job! Then come review time you get a mediocre review.  Why you ask?  I am doing the same work I was before, same job.  Management will tell you that now you are being reviewed and compared against others at level 51 so more is expected of you.  Promotions can be used as a way to phase you out.  If they want you gone they can promote you to level 52 so now you either have to transfer or end up with poor reviews at the higher level.  I have known people who moved to jobs at a lower level so they had room to grow.    Most people don't want to reach the dreaded level 63 or 64 I think which is where ALOT more is expected of you.  

Outside Redmond:  If you do not live in Redmond there are very few opportunities.  Remember the move every 3 years, Do the math

Work Life Balance:  This does not exist.  You will be expected to work/check email on vacations, holidays etc.   And respond.   I will say that they are flexible about things like leaving early to go to a parent/teacher meeting and things like that.  But you will work 60+ hours per week and be connected to email 24/7.  They do lots of lip service about how this will change but in the 10 plus years I have worked year it has not.  The trick is to take the popular vacations Christmas, July 4th, then everyone else is on vacation so you might not be bothered

Company/Product Info:  If you think you will have access to new products, think again.  You will have access when the public does.  You will find out info when the public does. External customers such as TAP will know before you do.  Mary Jo Foley will know before you do.  This applies to internal changes in upper management.  A memo goes out to the press the same time you receive it.  There is no level of trust.  There is also no internal system to share your ideas for product improvement.  There sort of is, but it really goes into a black hole

Email Alias Nitemare:   Want to talk to a real person about a problem you are having with an internal tool?  Good luck.  You will have to send email to an alias and they will respond within 48 hours.   Call the Help Desk?  Our Help Desk (the majority) is in India in case you are wondering.  Want to get a question answered about Benefits?  Again send email to an alias and wait 48 hours.  

Cost Center:  Do not work for a cost center.  Make sure you work for a Product Team or revenue generating team.  If you work in a Cost Center they are always nickel and diming and it gets worse every year.  Work for a Product Team, especially one that is profitable and the champagne and caviar are flowing.  I could not believe the difference.  

There are too many temps or contingent staff.  In my opinion it is just odd.  And they have important jobs and get treated like full time employees.  Until their contract is up and they have to leave.  

Diversity:  If you are a white male look elsewhere.  This company is all about hiring females and non-white employees for the sake of diversity.  Ironically there are very few African Americans here but people of other ethnicities 

Change for the sake of change:  Each fiscal year the manager's come out with their plans.  Everyone throws their all into it, then come June it does not matter because the fiscal year starts July 1st and everything changes.  Even if managers were on the right course they MUST change for the mere sake of change or they look like dead weight.  Don't our products do that too?

Summary:  If you are a student or technical rockstar looking for a home, this is not it.  This is a large corporation with all the politics that go with it and then some more BS specific to this company alone.  There are plenty of other options out there if you are gifted our just starting out.  The health insurance when it was good used to keep people here, not anymore.  I am waiting for some stock to vest and then I am looking for other opportunities"

- Obnoxious review system. Supposedly a ""meritocracy,"" but it's invariably a bunch of gossipy political BS.  Through three or four different systems, this has been the one constant.
- Lousy work/life balance. If your only interests are programming and more programming, you'll be fine.

12344,Microsoft,Software Engineer Track,2015-06-13,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Disclaimer: I realize the experience in Microsoft could be very division/team dependent, specifically I'm writing mostly for Azure and Bing.

1) Microsoft still does great tech., whole company emphasize on tech. and engineering first for the most the time (remember what Ballmer used to say at Microsoft conference). So you can end up with a resume doing cutting edge techs., but how much the industry cares about that when you walk out is dependent.

2) Microsoft is a great place to educate junior people, imo better than most of the ""on your own"" companies. Your career binds to a tech lead as junior people if he's technically strong (what supposed to be for most of time), you can improve a lot on how to do engineering. As a junior after 2-3 years in Microsoft with a right team you can be technically stronger than Google or Facebook made due to reasons above.

3) Company generally be nice for employees, they don't have good benefits like Facebook does but they do have comparable perks not including free food. For example they have legal insurance and ESPP which I found missing in Google or Facebook. Also they have free drink on quality/variance more or less the same about Google. Also I found their legal team (mostly for international employees) much more supportive/professional in general.

4) Some recent move make me think they are about to find some ways. But in general the moving slow pattern I mentioned below may prevent it from making them happen.","1) Microsoft is not a giant leader as it used to be, so be prepared for hardworking and high pressure (I'm talking about workload more than Google or Facebook).

2) Some times you need to deal with senior/intangible person owning some domains that not easy to deal with, and this also brings some politics issue. Mostly you won't find much in newer companies like Facebook (this also due to Facebook's unique culture I can't tell much). But yah you can still find some in other large companies in Google. But in general Microsoft has more of this kind of things.

3) Company has some issues preventing it from making stuffs fast. If you guys notice how Google struggles to move towards Mobile and still not succeed, Microsoft is just worse than this from this perspective."

12367,Microsoft,Massive Discrimination,2015-06-27,1.0,Software Development Engineer III,Pay was overall decent and project were generally interesting. Some people were very nice and I had members of my team volunteer to go to HR to protest my treatment by management.,"I am female and hearing impaired, and faced discrimination on both levels. I also witnessed racial discrimination.

When I pointed out an architectural flaw in the system, I was called a drama queen and ignored, until the system self-imploded from said flaw a few months later (of course I got no credit from pointing it out). I was never invited to team events and was blatantly told it was because I was a girl by other team members. I was the only female engineer on the team. My manager though topics like strippers was perfectly OK work conversation. 

As for hearing loss discrimination, it got progressively worse over time. People joked about me to ""not tell me to do something, I'd just hear it wrong."" This grew to being told not to talk in meetings, not being invited to meetings, and being told not to answer anything verbally - the only thing I was told I was allowed to verbally say is ""I'll get back to you with that"" and answer via e-mail. I was also told I was only allowed to answer e-mails in one or two sentences. Then all project ownership was taken away from me and given to someone else so they could ""manage my communication.""  I wear hearing aids and can lip read. All I needed was people to face me and talk one at a time, but they refused to do that and cut me out instead. I was told that as long as my ""verbal communication problems"" persisted, I would never be promoted again.

The only non-white member of my team had his computer hacked into by our mutual manager so the manager could send e-mails out from that person's computer when that person wasn't there, and effectively managed to destroy his e-mail credibility to the point where when the guy sent out an ""I quit!"" e-mail, no one at first believed him. Then the manager joked with someone else that I hadn't acted up enough for him to do that to me yet. I complained to HR about the whole incident, but nothing happened.

Those involved got away with everything, and are still at the company. HR said they saw no problems with any of this behavior."

I was there for over 7 years and despite all the PR about stack ranking going away, it still exists. In fact, it's even worse now as your direct managers have more impact on your ranking and compensation so, if you don't kiss up to them, you get nothing. 
In fact, MS has been reducing all the benefits given to employees over the years. 
There used to be a top-notch benefit package and now you have co-pays and deductibles. They used to give you a hiring bonus and now that is apparently gone. 
Food in the cafeteria used to be cheap. Now it's more expensive than eating out somewhere else.
Free soda was offered in cans. Now we get fountain soda so they can save money.
Managements response to Satya's announcement of layoffs intended to reduce management bloat that exists at MS on my team, was to instead fire a bunch of FTEs and replace them with contingent staff because they work for less money, all in an effort to keep their cushy jobs.
Management is clueless to how much one contributes to the team. Instead of focusing on their reports, they have meetings every day with each other and rely on reports that are inaccurate and what an engineer puts on their check-in. You can put anything on there and there is no follow-up on the success of the project. So, you have a bunch of people putting meaningless garbage on their reviews for projects that exist for no reason other than to put something on the review.

Benefits and Pay are still top notch compared to a lot of other companies.  It may not be Facebook or Google, but it's competitive.

There are almost way too many resources - if you're looking for information or need a product/service, someone can get it for you as long as you can justify it.  

Recruiting is top-notch. Bar-none probably the best system of interviewing - it's a great experience for the interviewee and interviewer - which means people tend to be a good fit (at least for the 6 months that your job is the same).

Innovation and excitement in some pockets - there are some really cool things happening with Hololens.  Small pockets of innovation within incubation teams are very inspiring.  

It really is a giving culture.  People volunteer, give money and promote social causes as part of their DNA.  It's not just for PR.","Constant change is not handled well.  Satya's arrival has prompted more innovation and bolder, better moves, but you're still talking about a 100K full-time work force.  Any change rolls through at a glacial pace.  Some teams are agile, but the majority can't pivot fast enough (and who can blame them?).  There are a lot of people who have been there 10+ years and no matter what, that encourages a settling in mentality that isn't really a fit for how the CEO thinks about the company.  

Collaboration is still pretty new - so people say they want to because it's the new ""in"" thing to do, but that doesn't mean they actually know how.  

Top level leaders, CEO and directs are mostly great and day to day coworkers are smart and motivated.  Middle management is a mess (and abundant) so it's hard to translate the company vision uniformly across teams.  If you're stuck in a backward facing, reactive org, you'll be frustrated. 

It's still a pretty political place.  History, size and constant change will make it really hard to stand out.  You need both smarts, savvy and connections and good luck to you if you don't have all three.

Satya is changing things, but not remotely to the extent the press narrative claims. Join Microsoft if you need a steady, boring job so you can raise a family — or if you don’t have better options. 

Don’t come here if you’re genuinely excited about being part of the next wave of technological innovation, or if you care about being at a fun, cool place to work. This ain’t it. *

When you see positive Glassdoor reviews for working at Microsoft, you should ask whether the reviewer has actually worked anywhere else. Microsoft typically hires people right out of college, who don’t yet realize they’re getting a bum workplace experience relative to our industry peers. It’s not a coincidence that almost never will you meet people voluntarily departing a top-tier tech company like Google, Apple or Facebook to work for Microsoft — even though countless MS employees leave daily to these competitors.

Why is that? Microsoft has 4 major flaws for a young person excited about tech.

1. IF YOU ARE YOUNG AND INSPIRED, DOING MICROSOFT LONG-TERM IS CAREER SUICIDE.

Microsoft is a fine place to go for 3 years out of college to learn a new discipline - especially if you didn’t get the GPA to go straight to a top-tier tech company like Google or Uber. 

But Microsoft is a terrible place to stay for the long term — unless you really just want to have kids, a suburban house, and just need a day job to pay for all that. Doing a long-term stint at Microsoft destroys your marketability: you will have to fight in every interview to prove that you can survive in the agile, autonomous, resource-constrained, Android/iOS environment that is the real world. Companies will assume the worst of you in every interview. When you’re ready to leave, it gets degrading fast.

Yeah, you ship Windows and Office to a billion people. Big impact opportunity, right? Well, McDonald’s ships about 2 billion hamburgers each year. Wouldn’t a job in McDonalds’ headquarters also be a big impact opportunity? And if your idea of innovation involves years of making incremental tweaks to the Big Mac recipe, or wasting 3 years of your life to bring some executive’s insane vision of a hybrid ice cream & chicken sandwich to market, sure!

And the financial buffer of working at a monopoly means you burn 3-5 years of your working life on a single preventable fiasco like Windows 8 or Vista, during which your Silicon Valley friends just had the time of their life and got filthy rich helping create Uber or Airbnb. Instead, you’ll be working on ridiculous projects that only make sense to Microsoft executives living in a suburban Redmond bubble. You will be the butt of jokes at parties with your college friends when you try to explain what you’re working on (“Wait, so it’s kindof like an iPad, but it has worse hardware specs, no software, it’s buggy as hell… and it’s more expensive than the iPad?”). 

2. YOU DON’T GET TO MAKE A DENT IN THE WORLD.

At Microsoft, you really won’t change the world. Not a bit. You will waste months of your life trying to get organizational buy-in to do what would take days or even hours at a Silicon Valley startup.

Microsoft is not a company that goes out and makes things better for customers, just out of employees’ own passion or conviction. There is no love in the Microsoft workplace culture — it really feels like working at a fading monopoly whose primary mission is to figure out how to keep cranking out bucketloads of cash, in a new reality that no longer needs it. 

This is what makes Microsoft such a boring and soulless place to work. You’ll find soullessness in the dull, corporate posters in the hallways, the bland workspaces, and the uninspired cafeteria food. And with the cloudy, dark skies making for dark and depressing open-seating workspaces (Microsoft’s last great perk of private offices is being phased out), it can sometimes feel like a real-life re-enactment of Apple’s “1984” commercial.

Microsoft does an amazing job selling interns on the company — amazing parties, food, concerts, free hardware, and lots of executive face-time. If you’re an intern, enjoy every moment of it. But remember that you’ll never get any of that once you work for the company — all you’re getting is a sales demo.


3. MICROSOFT IS A TRADITIONAL, HIERARCHICAL COMPANY

While tech companies are typically egalitarian and flat, Microsoft is traditional and hierarchical. This hierarchical workplace manifests in big ways, and in little ways.

In little ways, it just makes for a lousy work environment. In every e-mail you send, your job title and tenure rank (junior vs. midlevel vs. senior) appears at the bottom, so people can judge your ideas by your rank - just like the military. It means they serve the worst food of any tech company, since executives get personally catered meals and don’t have to eat the dogfood-quality lunches food themselves. And it explains why the shuttle service that takes you around campus is a time-sucking nightmare — executives have special “888” shuttles that actually work.

And in big ways, this means that if you have a great idea, you’re probably not going to get it into a product - unless it’s specifically your job or charter to do so. Microsoft doesn’t want you for your creativity - they want you for your ability to shut up and execute on other people’s (executives’) ideas.

In fairness, there are small improvements like the new annual Hackathon. Yes! For just a few days each year, your original ideas and your creativity are valued! But there are other companies where your ideas and conviction are valued every single day.


4. MICROSOFT DOESN’T CARE ABOUT YOU

Your immediate manager may care about you, but Microsoft as a company doesn’t. Microsoft won’t even do an exit interview when you quit. When you give notice that you’re leaving for a “competitor” (basically, any tech company worth its salt), you literally are escorted out the door. Your health care and paycheck is also terminated that very same day. 

HR interview? Nope, you’ll receive a survey that you literally can’t even fill out — because it expires the moment your MS e-mail account shuts down (d’oh!). They literally don’t care why you left. 

It sounds brutal, but Microsoft at its core is traditionally an unkind company. Until recently, they even required managers to give bad reviews to roughly 20% of their teams on a forced curve (“stack ranking”). When they ended this management practice, Microsoft’s leadership never even had the humility to acknowledge or admit that this was ever a bad idea or unjustly hurt employees.

Working at Microsoft also means you’re also stuck in Seattle. Competitors like Google let you work as an engineer in almost any exciting city in the world: New York, Munich, London, San Francisco - you name it, they have an office there. At Microsoft, well, you better love Redmond. At least it’s only a 45 minute bus trip during rush hour to Seattle.

While companies like Google lavish new toys and freebies on employees, Microsoft is dirt cheap with employees. The only “free” hardware I got was a junky Surface RT (promised by Ballmer to be ‘free’, but then we had to agree in writing that it was actually the company’s property and would be returned if we left), and a Windows Phone (which was only ‘free’ if we signed up for a nearly $2000 contract at the employee’s sole expense - despite the unambiguous promise Steve Ballmer made at the company meeting of a ‘free’ phone. And true to Microsoft, they never explained or apologized for not actually giving employees what they promised us - as an MS employee, you’re generally expected to just shut up and be grateful for whatever you get.)

Microsoft seeks to be a hardware maker, but offers marginal discounts to employees at best. You can get a better price on the internet for an Xbox or Surface. Whereas Apple gives employees $500 off a new Mac, Microsoft gives you nothing like that. Microsoft-logo’d clothing at the company store costs as much as actual fashionable major-brand merchandise at a major clothing store.

(This isn’t necessarily a problem, as a noteworthy sign of the company’s downward relevance is that almost nobody will ask you to buy MS discounted products anymore, certainly not compared to when I started.)

It just goes on and on.

Overall, Microsoft isn’t horrible - but if you’re a talented young person who wants to make a dent in the universe, don’t come to Microsoft."

Fixing bugs doesn't earn you points at all. 

Senior Leadership ruled like dictators. If you break the dev build (not even prod build), you will be shamed, your checkin privileges are revoked. Abusive language is used at times. This meant the blame game is played. Private emails are forwarded around. Project Managers fresh out of schools are hired to boss you around. A dev only writes code was the mantra. 

In 3 years, I slowly felt the soul sucked out of me. They pay you well, but to them you are just a dev who will work 60-70 hours. You'd see people working weekends and late nights. It is highly frowned upon to only work 8 hours."

- NW is a wonderful place to live","- Management - most managers I've dealt with only manage up and a little sideways and simply don't have the people manager skills or desires to properly take care of their reports. They only listen to their loudest reports. This management ""culture"" seems to be a result of Microsoft's stock early, quick ascent until 2000. Managers didn't see the need to nurture and build their reports since many Softies retired after 4-5 years. Why bother building people when you knew they were short term anyway? After year 2000 people getting rich at MS dropped significantly but the management culture did not change and appeared oblivious their old idea of being lazy and telling their reports to own their own careers was not healthy for the company nor their reports. Perhaps things are finally changing with the new review structure but unfortunately those managers who thrived in the old system are still the gatekeepers to making the new system work. Good luck.  
- At least in the groups I was part of, the engineers who get hired are consistently from a narrower and narrower band of personality types which restricts diversity of thought and action. I guess it makes it easier this way to plug and play engineers when the wind changes and a VP or director is replaced and they want to reorg. 
- Dev and test merging into one. I'm a dev and I always respected and appreciated those in the test groups who had a passion for testing and breaking things. Their passion wasn't necessarily to design and build the software. Now, everyone gets thrown into the same soup and guess what, the former SDETs are usually handed a lot of the test work but now, they won't rank as high as the former SDEs since many DEV managers still value product  code output over testing. Many outside companies are happy to grab the disgruntled former SDETs so it's a boon for those companies. Unless this changes, it will be easy to predict, over time, Microsoft software quality will drop. 
- Work life balance. It's getting worse. I talk with my old friends still at Microsoft and they continue to be more and more warn out with increasing loads being placed on them. Some are dev managers and even though the products they work on, especially cloud, are getting many more users, their teams are not allowed to grow. In fact one friend who has had a number a folks leave over the past few years because of lack of work life balance, has not been allowed to hire new people in to at least backfill those who have left. Yes, the team has to get more efficient but largely by making the rest work harder and harder. Comparing Microsoft's profit/employee ratio to largely advertising companies like Google is a fallacy."

Oddly enough middle management and some other teams are not subjected to this but technical resources are and the evaluation is typically done by non technical managers who have no idea who's good and who's bad. The market for skilled experienced engineers is finite and with this policy Microsoft is only making it difficult for them to stay competitive as more talent leaves than comes in.  I've seen some pretty pathetic new hires recently simply because less talent is interested and the limited pool of resources has been polluted by this arbitrary and obsolete standard.

Microsoft really gives its employees the ability to succeed, be healthy, and help the world. Also lots of great career path opportunities if you're willing to move to the west coast.  Full of smart people that are all willing to help out and try the companies ""dogfood"" as they call it.  Everybody seems to want to always try new software and technologies and really win in everything they do.","Though the company is doing a lot to make it more competitive in cloud and mobile spaces, and feel more like a startup with hackathons and social competitions it is still a big company and it can still take a long time to figure out who is the correct contact to help you get something done or a port opened in a firewall.  Also the culture of ""dogfooding"" means that everybody pretty much always wants to use only Microsoft products and services which makes sense but there is just so much good open source software out there.  They are working on becoming more open source friendly but aren't quite there yet."

12624,Microsoft,Director A&O,2015-04-28,3.0,Director,"Microsoft people are incredibly bright.  They are certainly above average when compared to most companies (that are not tech companies).  When working on a good team, you will find that your work product excels and exceeds what you could accomplish alone.

Also, as Microsoft is an incredibly large organization, it can offer lots of possibilities -- different careers, products, geographies, and experiences.  This is almost unparalleled even in other large multi nationals.  At worst, you will be exposed to people from all over the world with different viewpoints and priorities and this is always a good thing.","When I left, and I have heard it is changing, Microsoft had become very bureaucratic.  Unfortunately, trying to get hings done required the synchronization of many groups and there was often no incentive for alignment.  even if management was aligned, the front line troops often weren't, which meant things would not get done.  And being a large organization, blame was rarely applied.

Also, the evaluation system, which has also been changed and should be investigated, was one that created individual rewards at team expense.  Provided that that has been changed, this may not longer be an issue.

Regardless, try to find a group that is as autonomous as possible and a boss that has a reputation for fighting for his employees, as that will always be key in a large organization."

Level of communication attempts to be high","Many teams working at Microsoft are in direct competition with one another. Instead of working together toward a common goal each team treats each other as an enemy. So sharing information is a painful process. 
This mentality has bled into the old Microsoft personnel and working with them is not pleasant. You'll have to constantly watch your back as they'll throw you under the bus without a second thought. This sometimes will be your own teammates!
Growth is good at the start but Sr. Management is a wall. Lots of 10+ year Microsoft people clogging up the ranks making it difficult to move up past a certain point.

12666,Microsoft,"Innovators are not risks, not assets.",2015-04-16,3.0,Program Manager,"Lots of challenges, amazing opportunities, and if you enjoy being diplomatic, you'll go very far. The trick to working at Microsoft is doing what you're told every time and asking for more. If you're able to do that, promotion velocity is high, rewards are strong, and you'll have a relatively stable career. 

Some teams are very in line with the startup mindset (looking at you: Bing, Outlook, Exchange, Skype, Xbox, and IoT).

Benefits are decent, prime card is awesome, food is good, people are cool.","In list form. 
- Management does not know how to handle or reward innovators or tinkerers. If you're the type who asks ""why"" often, you'll eventually become unhappy because you do work for shareholders and they do set the direction. 
- Asking why will actually get you into a lot of trouble in some cases because you'll be looked at as a risk. 
- The current ""culture change"" is not moving fast enough (if at all). The CEO and low level management are very out of sync. 
- Because of the culture change, many new problems are coming to light... (what do you do when you find something more pressing than your day job? Do what's right for your customers, or do what you're told? The former should be rewarded even when it contradicts the latter) 
- Many of the hackathon winners feel like they weren't rewarded or appreciated from their efforts at OneWeek. Some teams felt like their efforts were absorbed, taken, or dropped (to be fair to Microsoft, it was a work event and I sort of feel they shouldn't be that upset over this. To be fair to those people, the did bring a bunch of new innovation to Microsoft and were not actually rewarded in many cases)
- The recent focus on hiring diverse talent is being spearheaded by lower level management who are actively trying to manage diverse talent out. (I'm specifically referring to a group of people but I'm not going to say which group. I will say it has nothing to do with race, sex, gender, or similar.) 
- The current review system is heavily based on your relationship with your manager and your value to your manager, not your impact. (there's a slider...)

12670,Microsoft,Deeply regret the precious years of my life that I lost working at Microsoft,2015-05-04,1.0,Senior Software Development Engineer,"- Brand value to some extent - Microsoft still commands decent brand value outside, so if you have clocked a good number of years specially as an full time employee, it does have some weight-age. 

- Lots of real estate and large office spaces (Redmond City is pretty much built around Microsoft offices) - Compared to other companies cramming their employees on floors, Microsoft has many buildings and most employees get a room by themselves. This is changing though, with many teams moving to open floor plans. If you are in Redmond, the commute is awesome. Your office would be 5-10 minutes from your home. 

- Good hiring bar which leads to intellectual peers and team mates - I think this is the best part. A lot of candidates get rejected and the bar is pretty high. Because of this, only the creme makes it into the company.

- Good perks specially the healthcare benefits and stock options you get in every appraisal cycle.","I spent a lot of years at Microsoft. The exact number of years is irrelevant, but looking back, I deeply regret how many years I have lost to really not doing anything substantial (i.e, changing the world). I will try to provide some insights to help you decide. 

You wont ship a thing in years : I have been in teams which have not shipped anything externally for years. Most of the work is lost either because the product is shelved or because the sponsor of the project vanished (everyone in Microsoft knows when to jump off a sinking boat really well). 

New leadership : The new CEO is doing a lot of good things. But things continue to be the same internally. Most changes that are pushed down remain in the news for a few weeks and are then conveniently forgotten. They are done because the CEO wants it to be done that way. No one really believes in it, but since they have to protect their jobs, they will pretend to adhere. They just do it because they were asked to.  

No of engineers Vs work available : With about 60,000 people in R&D and limited product lines (Windows, Bing, Office, Xbox, SQL, Azure to name a few), honestly there are more engineers than the work available in the company. Most teams re-invent the wheel by doing the same projects across different orgs. This is what I did and saw many other teams do in my long tenure with the company. We used to do exactly the same work that was already done by some other team often knowing that it was already attempted. And to make it worse, we would leave the work half baked so that some other team would again do the same thing in the future.

Complacency : No one questions anything because they just want to get their paycheck and continue happily. 

No worthy competitors in the neighborhood : There is absolutely no other big company in and around Redmond  which could absorb Microsoft employees and also pay the same salaries. This creates a terrible situation. Employees don't want to move out of Microsoft as they cannot find a job that pays as much. Honestly, many employees are also afraid they will not be able cope up with the high demands of jobs at other companies. That's the bitter truth, whether anyone confesses it or not. 

No goodwill for other development centers : I will keep this short. There is not much goodwill in HQ, Redmond for other, possibly more efficient, global development centers. My managers and their bosses would do everything possible to malign the efforts of other development centers and create as many obstacles as possible to make their work look bad. 

Dev/Test/Combined Engineering - The Dev/Test orgs continue to be the pillars of the company, but with the latest combined engineering model things have started to deteriorate. As an example, look at reviews of the Office products which calls them half-baked . Quality is non-existent at Microsoft nowadays. 

Performance appraisals - Earlier there was a rating system which was a good thing because you knew your trajectory. If you got good ratings over a few cycles, it would create a good pressure to get you promoted. The rating system was eliminated a year ago and now there is no indication of when your next promo might happen or how is the employee trending. It is just a continuum and you can stay in that limbo state as long as you wish to. 

Poor end user products - To top it all, the company makes poor products. I know you are thinking why did I spend so much time in the company when I think so poorly about their products? To be honest, I tried my best to improve them when I was around. But I could barely make a dent. Compared to other companies, it is difficult to rely on Microsoft products say in a life and death situation (for ex, with your smartphone). 

Already many teams are loosing revenue to other software companies that are selling free software. This has lead to massive layoffs. It wont be long before the remaining customers move to these new platforms, please note that these customers purchased Microsoft products mostly because they did not have a choice at that time. Now they do."

2. Fairly simple promotion route (can be promoted every 1.5 years if you're slightly above average) assuming you're in a growing Organization (Cloud + Enterprise is hiring and growing, so it's more easily get promoted there than in a well established organization like Windows or Office.
3. Work Life Balance is really up to you. I have seen people come in every day and work less than 40 hours a week and still get promoted (albeit at a slower pace than others)
4. Looks good on the resume, and there wont be a shortage of recruiters reaching out to you.","Microsoft was once the Mecca for Software Engineers. While it's now still prestigious, start-ups and other big companies (FB, Google, Amazon) are held in higher esteem. The company is still trying to become more agile in nature. They've done this by laying off staff, and converting all SDETs into Software Engineers. Due to the conversions, some organization are still figuring out what to do as they now have people with decades of experience testing code who are expected to now compete with other Devs who have decades of experience writing code. Teams which run web services are slowly starting to release at quicker intervals, but it's still a work in progress. 

The culture is different in each org, so be careful of which teams you choose. Middle management is still embroiled in politics. Reorgs are also fairly common, so do not get to attached to one manager.

You will definitely be the a small cog in a massive machine if you join Microsoft. You will not have much power to affect the company. So if you're looking for high impact work where you can be agile and heavily dictate the future of the product, then this may not be the company for you."

A lot of money.  Microsoft has the cash to fund your bold projects as long as the business plan that you propose is solid.
The new cafeteria have good foods and ambience. 
Good benefits, including my favorite of matching charitable givings.","A lot of mundane work that you need to get out of the way before you have time to look at the big picture and strategize your work.  These include a lot of process overhead; there are probably good reasons for them, but they take away time otherwise could be spent on innovation and collaboration. Advice: be really quick with the mundane stuff and spend as much energy as possible on the strategy and prioritization.
Everything is kept in SharePoint, and by default permission is denied, so a lot of wasted time finding the right documents and more wasted time tracking down document owners and asking for access.
Despite the attempt to turn around the ""hero"" culture and despite the push for more collaboration, the word collaboration at Microsoft means something different from what I understand it means coming from Silicon Valley.  The ""hero"" culture is in the way.  People aren't willing to let go of ideas that they can take credits from even though it's not the best idea.
Despite the nominally new performance review system, the old spirit of stack-ranking remains; managers simply change names of what they call the different tiers of performers.  The function of how well the company perceives your performance is in large part how much your manager is willing to fight for you and how much political capital she/he has in the calibration meeting.  The only true way to transform this culture is to stop the individual bonus and to give bonus at the team level.
The number one priority is revenue, not the users, which encourages short-termism and stifles innovation -- or maybe I was on a wrong team."

Good pay and benefits, and MSDN subscription. Great campus environment and learning facilities. Lots of technical and social events to network and mingle with your fellow Microsoft employees and leadership.","Its very charming to join Microsoft but the consulting practice, specially the public sector services practice is not the best place to join, at least based on my own personal experience. If you are looking to work for Microsoft and want to grow your career, try to join the other business and product groups. 

Consultants are expected to work on multiple projects to meet sometimes difficult utilization goals and held accountable even if their main job is to deliver and not sell. You will be expected to travel 100%. Instead of complementing the great products Microsoft makes, there is too much focus on quantity then quality which is doing nothing but hurting the Microsoft brand. 

You will not be rewarded for your extra contributions and keeping customers happy, and helping grow the business even if you miss on a single negligible operational/administration commitment. Microsoft has done away with the stack ranking model but unfortunately some leadership in the consulting practice is still using this model."

Not the top pay company, but is good.","1. The Windows technology is not used by the world. And it's going downward, so your experience at Microsoft will no longer help you when you find new jobs outside. Because everybody else are using something different.
2. The Benefit is going down. The medicals increased deductible, like 3K for two people family. 3.75K for family with 1 kid.
3. bureaucracy and politics. Now revolution is going on, like agile(ship monthly), flatten structural, merged engineering. But the many level of leads and managers are not going away. After a while, they fall back to their previous role. The lead now doesn't own head count, but they are doing exactly the same thing as before. That's pushing others.
4. The famous Stack ranking system. It is being revolutionized, but it's still there. And now Microsoft have a lot of crazy policies like: if you didn't get good review last year, you can't move within Microsoft, you have to leave for other company. If you leave Microsoft as FTE, you can't work for it until 6 months later even as vendor. My friend was just forced out of MS, now they don't fire you, they ask you to voluntarily resign from MS, with very small amount of money no matter how many years you have served here.
MS is becoming more and more mean, and less sympathy here."

Examples include not being able to hire sales folks even into Q4 of the year and still blame  folks for not making number . Make partnerships with your competitors (aka SFDC) and expect you to sell against them taking away your only perceived advantage in terms of product integrations .

Microsoft has been doing excellent innovation, and it was a pleasure to have been a part of the corporation and see the evolution of those products and services. During my tenure, I went from a technical writer to a director, and felt Microsoft had my back as an employee. The company has clear values that put customers first but never at the expense of the employees. We worked toward clear goals in my organization (Office) and were rewarded for innovation and results. The everyday benefits of working for Microsoft are simply amazing -- great 5 star restaurants (I wouldn't call them cafeterias), soccer fields, baseball diamonds, fantastic medical benefits that include vision and dentistry, employee stock purchase plan, generous 401K, and the pay is on the high side for the industry.","While Microsoft was a growing enterprise, the work/life balance was tilted toward the work end of the equation.

I didn't move around as much as I should have (note to reader - move around)  but I was really happy with the group I was in and the work that we produced. Lots of opportunity to move around if you do choose, although I believe they want you to stay in a single role for at least a year.","Challenges working at Microsoft which is a massive corporation is cross teams or divisions. Near impossible. If your role and success is dependent on other organizations it is a steep uphill battle.

The company goals are challenging and that makes it great in my opinion. They offer fair pay, good benefits, (They changed the medical benefits 2 years ago due the projected  raising heath care costs associated with Obama Care).  The employees are encouraged by the direction of the company since Satya Nadella took over for Steve Ballmer. Microsoft has become obsessed with their customers and the experiences they have with their products. Additionally, they are more open with their product categories. This is demonstrated by their recent moves to offer the Office suite of products across competitor ecosystems. Overall, I would recommend Microsoft as a great place to work.","Here are the trade offs to the impactful work, fair pay, benefits, and opportunity for personal growth. Culture, one of the most challenging aspects of working at Microsoft is navigating the diverse work groups to get daily duties done. 75% of the job is focused internally verses the customer. Their are a lot of smart people who think their way is the only way to crack a nut at times. It can be difficult to deal with. 

They have changed the review process in the recent future with the goal of connecting with your manager 4 times during the fiscal year. These are called connect meetings. You are asked to request feedback from peers across your organization. This is where the challenge lies when working at Microsoft. If you have a strong manager and great team your career at Microsoft will go will."

12805,Microsoft,"Trying to be better, still old habits die hard.",2015-03-18,2.0,,"Engineering: Great place to learn world-class engineering. Experience the long term consequences of good/bad decisions of the past, appreciate them for your own wisdom.  Strong appreciation for quality, testing, and presentation.  Development tools used to be under-supported, but in the recent years they become much better supported on-par like products.  In the past, the practice of delving in a non-Windows platform even as a hobby would be against HR policy, but now cross-platform development is recently more acceptable/necessary.  Several opportunities for technical depth and impactful deliverables, depending on teams.

Benefits: Used to be great overall. Now they are still very good in a few areas, overall they are more closer to other larger companies.  Pay is comparable with the larger companies. 

Career: The company is now strongly catered toward advancing manager roles.

Donations/Volunteering: Good support from outstanding members.","Still lacking collaborative environment:
Seen the cartoon of the Microsoft organization chart with guns at itself? Yes, it is true.  In the recent years, the company has somewhat finally coming into terms with the problem and is trying to shift to a more collaborative environment.  Unfortunately, the successful veterans, many of who are managers of other people or owners of product areas, are failing/do not want to adopt.  Normal human behavior, they try but it is unnatural and revert to the old comfortable (unhelpful) ways, that gave them control and success in the past.  Several of them moved to other companies (e.g. Google) and are known to continue on the bad patterns. The problem is becoming lesser in Microsoft, but still pretty significant. This is not an issue with new hires without past experience; new hires do bring a more open/positive energy. 

Little life-balance:
This is something that has consistently been insane and has consistently been the lowest bucket of priorities.  It is an unspoken consequence that people who practice life-balance will not advance, or advance extremely slowly.  The problem is that if you are given a task and take the time to do it, you will be blocking other people who have less life-balance, and so managers rather give you a less impactful task.  Bottom line, a less impactful result means a lower review score.  If you want to advance and/or keep your job, do not count on life-balance, specially if your manager is from the old culture.  As many people over the years have attested, this is often not worth it; missed the time to live with your kids as they grow up, divorces, etc.

Weak individual contributor roles:
The company is now more catered to advancing manager roles.  However to become one is very difficult and political.  Individual contributors are now treated more-or-less as well-paid laborers.  Opportunities for innovation are very scarce and very tightly controlled; there are instead huge loads of fairly dull tasks that needs labor.  Most of the time an IC will be on these tasks and will no way get an award for them.  However, a manager having several ICs completing all these tasks will definitely get rewarded.  People have observed again and again how some managers are rewarded almost consequence-free, regardless of the product outcome, attrition level, or less-than-honest influencing.

Very bad leadership coordination:
Managers do not coordinate with each other very well, even with their own peers.  Often you will find separate teams with overlapping efforts, one manager is trying to out-do the other, instead of trying to align something greater together.  This was more pervasive in the past, lesser of a problem now, but still there (old culture).  This is a common source of frustration among ICs in trying to figure out what to work/not work."

Always had a sense of pride working at Microsoft.,"I worked nearly 10 years at Microsoft and always looked forward with optimism to working with intelligent, dedicated, hard working coworkers/leaders and on cool projects.  However, I mainly I saw poor middle management, dysfunctional teams, constant re-orgs, back stabbing, empire building and cost cutting that during my  time I was ""reduced in force"" twice on two teams.  The first time I landed a new team and never left the company, the second time I wasn't given such luxury--despite getting 1s and 2s and promos over the last few years.  

I left MS with a bitter feeling that I never found what I was looking for.  I met some very intelligent people, but seemingly most had significant character flaws that were disastrous to building high performing teams.  What frustrated the most was the constant empire building and self preservation that occurred at middle and upper management levels...basically what they tell you is just lip service to make you feel good, but no substance.  (Not uncommon at big corporations, so that shouldn't be a surprise)

Before my second ""RIF"" I had two teams interested in having me move, but my last GM pleaded on two occasions that I not leave; so thinking I was favored by him that would mean a brighter future, so I stayed--yet not 3 months later I was axed with 4 other coworkers.  Best I could figure is that we weren't ""diversified"" enough to keep, despite all being top team performers with important projects.  Not sure who or how the layoff decision was made, but from my perspective, when you have common traits as far as gender, race, sexual orientation, you don't stand a chance if you are in competition with the  more uncommon folks working next to you even if they perform worse.  (Honestly, 4 individuals on that team who could be classified as diverse had either delivered nothing of important in years, stayed in the same role for many years, or actually screwed up to cost the company money.)  Probably not an unusual situation at large corporations since meeting certain diversification requirements are important to someone up high, so for me it's time to move on to a smaller company."

If you're looking to learn about business best practices and cutting edge ways of going to market, this is a great place to do that.","The biggest challenges are work/life balance and stack-ranking. They say ""Microsoft will take all that you give it,"" and the expectation is that you give it your all -- at night, over the weekend, instead of your child's sporting events, etc. Then, with stack-ranking (which I heard they've since done away with), you're always competing with your peers to work as much/hard as they do. As someone that had a family to take care of, it was frustrating to have to compete with my 20-something peers that gave their lives to the company to prove their worth. Not all teams had these same challenges (but many do), so if you're interviewing with Microsoft, please be sure to ask about the team's expectations and views on work/life balance with the hiring manager."

Restructure upon restructure has left everyone a bit confused on how to get business done.

But because the leadership of the company is feudal and constantly reverses itself, and the middle management is left to itself to create a Disney-sized theme park dedicated to ""Lord of the Flies"" style handling of their human chattel, none of the pros matter much.","Very little of the old company remained when I went back. The stock benefits are gone replaced with a partner level elitist  group managing the company to maintain their own comfort rather than innovate or compete. Stock itself is meaningless, and the pay and benefits is marginal (both of which are not real reasons to join a company, but are part of the old myth of MS's wealth and prosperity, which is long gone.) Innovation is of course routinely suppressed and rejected. There are so many ""cons"" to list that this would be an entire compendium of books (for example book #22 would be ""Harry Potter and the Abominable Review System that Keeps Wage Slaves in Their Place""). So I'll skip to the end: Microsoft refuses to change and keep with modernization of technology. Its hard to blame them, as IBM did the same thing with mainframes to maintain their market position and profit. In the future, you will see a time when MS executives are on the street trying to sell a CDROM, shrink-wrapped version of Windows 22/Office 2023 with the tag-line of ""Its all we really understand how to make"". And don't be drawn in by their lip-service to anything ""cloud"" or ""online""...they'll revert back to shrink-wrapped product on 1.44 floppy disk given even the smallest chance trying to relive the ""glory days"" of their revenue heydays."

This is a great company for the people who want stability without potential for a strong career trajectory.","Microsoft is a hard place for women to grow their careers.  There is much talk about diversity in race and gender without much true action. While HR says that pay disparity is less than one percent by gender BY JOB LEVEL, women must note that in many cases they are doing the same job as a man but being paid at a lower level...so it is all semantics. As an example, many female sales managers in the US are level 64. Male sales managers are often level 66. When MSFT says women and men are paid the same by level, in the example above this would mean that L64 female sales managers are paid at the same rate as L64 men...but they leave out that level 64 men are sales reps. Equality would be raising the women to the same level 66 as their male counterparts and paying the same amount for an equal job.  With MSFTs semantics issues, women should start to be concerned with the integrity of the company as it relates to the core company values.  As an employee for nearly two decades always in the top 20%, I personally realized that my values for equality didnt align to the company values."

finally got rid of review numbers, but don't believe that means the stack rank is gone.","management buying into every stupid trend in the industry from open space offices to getting rid of test/quality.
this idea that the more test you have the less responsibility dev will have on their code and the more buggy it will be delivered is crazy (so more test == more bugs therefore less test == higher quality). This is the most recent manifestation of what I encountered early in my time at MSFT when as we approached a ship date the quality bar would be redefined so that you were told not to enter any defects short of common crashes.
same thing with open space, when I started every employee got an office at 110 square feet. then it went to fishbowl glass sliding door office at 65 square feet, then it went to open space in a ""six pack"" where 6 cube wall divided spaces shared a bay, then they came in and took the dividing walls, then the name plates for the six pack went from 6 name spaces to 12 just in case they wanted to add more folks to the space. Another group put us in a completely open floor with some nonsensical discussion about how open space (""radical colocation"") would allow us to cooperate better. open space was so noisy they had to issue us all noise canceling headphones so now I was sitting at a desk staring at my boss in front of me with noise canceling headphones on so that my coworkers could only get my attention by waving their hands or sending me email (didn't exactly foster cooperation).
review had to fit to a curve, so even if everyone was a rock star someone got screwed on the review (this was explained that it encouraged folks to move around in the company to spread out excellence). the result of getting a non rock star review number was that you could not even get considered for jobs within the company."

Depending on the team you work for, Microsoft can be very sluggish to respond to market needs. There's still a sense of fiefdoms and intransigence to new ideas. There are many long-timers there (though many were laid off recently). So, people who have less time in aren't given as much respect.

Great benefits.  Diversity is highly valued within the company culture with opportunities for everyone. Lot of flexibility in work arrangements.","The biggest challenge is that success within the company has significant demands that can be a challenge to maintain a good work/Life balance.
Recent health benefits changes have resulted in significant increase in healthcare costs for employees."

12996,Microsoft,Long Time Employee,2015-02-06,4.0,Senior Service Engineer,Microsoft was a great place to learn and grow in a fast paced cutting edge environment. I highly recommend the experience.,In the day to day work I found a lot more managers who were not leaders. Often times they would just reiterate what their bosses said and there were critical times where they would misinterpret the message and send the wrong message down the line.
12997,Microsoft,Detached,2015-02-07,2.0,Designer,"The salary here is great. You will undoubtedly have some great, fun, funny and intelligent people surrounding you. Benefits are OK.","The company is obviously very large and thus makes it very difficult for groups and departments to get things done.
The communication between departments is absolutely horrible which causes projects to get delayed, sidetracked or just cancelled very often. This also leads to a redundant workload that has possibly even been done by another team!

There is way to much of an engineering driven culture at Microsoft which tends to make the product or service you work on very bland and unintuitive.

To say the company is risk adverse is an understatement. If you are looking to create something new and exciting then this isn't the place for you. Get ready to iterate on unlikely/unrealistic scenarios that pander to business needs much more that the people that use them.

There is very much a 'live to work' mentality at Microsoft rather than a 'work to live' mentality. This leads to stressed out teams and even more stressed managers. 

There isn't a vision of where the company is going in departments let alone at a company level. This can be very uninspiring."

- Satya is transforming company culture for the better
- recent changes to modernize product development roles make sense","- old-Microsoft culture traits (aggressiveness, lack of collaboration, internal competition) still linger among small pockets of old-timers

Health care is no longer free, but they do provide money each year to cover a portion of what you might have to pay, so you just have to save that up for 2 years to no longer have to pay anything out of pocket."
13005,Microsoft,Great place to work,2015-01-08,5.0,Software Development Engineer,"Company is very forward-looking with the new leadership (Satya). Culture is rapidly evolving to be caught up with, or ahead of, the competition. Wide reach, with lots of opportunities to make an impact on the world.

Satya Nadella is doing a great job of securing Microsoft's continued relevance and innovative new products. Plenty of opportunities to work independently to deliver results. Schedule flexibility for most roles.,Silos still exist preventing a feeling of a shared vision. Some organizations more entrepreneurial than others. Need for stakeholder buy-in means be prepared to attend a lot of meetings before anything gets done. Teams sometimes rush to develop their own systems rather than using existing capabilities resulting in duplicate and unnecessary business processes. Competitive bonus structure still fosters a tendency to throw others under the bus to get ahead. Ability to navigate Internal politics is critical to your career.

Since IT is considered a service division that supports the profit making business units. Most buildings are not even on the main corporate campus. The Pros is that you get easier parking. Not a big deal.,"I worked at Microsoft IT for 5 years. It started well with a good manager and ended with 2 bad managers. Just like other positions at Microsoft, managers matter a lot. I talked to other engineers at product groups like Windows and Office. Their culture seemed to be more engineering and technical focused than playing games and politics. There is politics at every workplace. Microsoft IT seemed to get it the most. My review was heavily affected by if other engineers liked my personality rather than liked my engineering contribution. Who decided that? The ranking system dictated by the managers."

 - It is a wonderful place to become immersed in multiple game changing technologies.
 - Few places offer such a rich and diverse workforce allowing you to learn how to work with people better.  Something that is more valuable and will last longer than any technology. 
 - Microsoft allows you to take training, stay on top of new trends and grow you strengths.
 - There is always someone who can help.  There is a vast wealth of material on hand for research to get you started on new projects quicker, pointed in the right direction, or help you out of a jam.
 - Good corporate values","- If you are in a group that is in a cost center, and particularly if costs are being cut, then the only way you can grow is often for someone else to shrink.  This has incented poor behavior in some places.  
 - There is no end to work, that is making your project and yourself better.  Balance that with your management. You need to balance work/life or it can get out of control.  
- it is not a meritocracy, you will need to network and sponsors to protect and promote your career just as much as doing good work.  
- rewards are very tied to making your direct management chain better.  If you helped another team outside your direct managements unbrella do well, you often are not rewarded for that."

13111,Microsoft,Excellent Company,2015-01-19,4.0,Director of Operations,Large technology company with global recognition.  Many jobs available with ability to move in career and location.  Company changes rapidly and seeks the best and brightest.  The company spends a lot on employees to ensure skills and morale are kept current.  Very good benefits.  The office environment and hours are very flexible.  Strong company ethics for individuals and the corporate environment.  With their new CEO last year the company seems to be on an upswing with product development and consumer sentiment.,The company will take every hour you give it and will quickly expect long hours as the norm.  There is a constant push to 'go faster'.  There is also a Microsoft 'kool aid' mentality where Microsoft technology is considered the best and is the only tolerated technology - all others are admonished regardless of their merits.  The company maintains a minimum attrition rate (for what they call 'good' attrition - i.e. low performers).  I have seen many good employees walked out the door because attrition targets had to be met.

Although flagship products have a very large organization size, individual working teams are  small, providing cross-discipline fraternity within the larger context.

The working environment is casual with respect to dress codes and personal communication. Work hours are flexible.

Commute options are plentiful. If you drive, there's ample parking, while Microsoft bus, or city transit covers much of the Greater Seattle area.","In general there's more work to be done than fits in an 8 hour day. For nearly 20 years, I generally worked a 10hr day 5 days a week, with another half day accumulated across evenings or weekends.

The annual review process imposes a ranking across team members which is not representative of how well they did their jobs. This can lead to deflated compensation and advancement opportunities for individuals who are doing their job well, and vice versa can advance employees who don't deserve it simply because they did better work than their team mates who were less competent. This process is slowly changing, but I have no insight as to what and when new policies will be in place."

13165,Microsoft,Great Employer that treats employees as a valued resource.,2015-01-05,4.0,Policy Advisor,Good management.  Global influence.,Large company.  Not as nimble as it needs to be in its industry.
13166,Microsoft,Tough Transition,2015-01-05,4.0,Senior Business Development Manager,"[+] Breadth of career opportunities -- Work locations all over the world and in many different disciplines
[+] Much emphasis placed on Azure and O365, central to winning the biggest shift in IT since the PC.
[+] Company encourages cross-training and transitioning to different disciplines, although sometimes difficult, in practice.
[+] Exciting transition to cloud and mobile business underway -- Many new career opportunities in these businesses.
[+] CEO is leading culture change, breaking many legacy assumptions, restructuring product groups, where necessary, and attempting to make the company less insular, more innovative, more open to cross-team collaboration, while eradicating the toxic, back-stabbing culture, associated with the former evaluation system, known as stack-ranking, as extensively reported on this site.","[-] Not all of the restructuring has hit the right targets.  The SMS&G sales and marketing groups have only made minor changes -- the usual ""pruning"" of non-conformists, instead of removing the inward-facing roadblocks to change.
[-] Outside of Azure and O365, prospects are mixed and direction less sure.  
[-] Windows revenue (client and server) declining.  
[-] Still unsure how to monetize consumer-facing services.  
[-] Mobile and device strategy is fragmented.
[-] Although top-down efforts to change toxic culture are encouraging, everyone who has risen through the ranks, during the past 10 years, did so in the context of the old culture.  Many of the leaders still look at their careers as a zero sum game, where they win only by making someone else lose.
[-] As in most large companies, norms of equity preclude offering sufficient rewards for taking entrepreneurial risk.
[-] Sales and marketing is the most risk-averse part of the organization -- most in need of a shakeup."
13167,Microsoft,"Great company, getting old and tired",2015-01-05,3.0,,"Lots of technology
Wide swath of areas to innovate
Improving HR practices, with a focus on work-life balance","Losing their way in many areas
Over-complicated approval infrastructure
Politics happening at all levels -- too many decisions made on the basis of political agendas over the real needs of customers and the market
Too much focus on the business model -- it is important, but they should focus on the customer first and let the business model come from optimizing the customer experience"
13168,Microsoft,Bureaucratic & political but getting better,2015-01-05,3.0,Principal Solution Manager,"Because Microsoft is in so many different businesses there is a wide array of career options and opportunities.   The company is becoming more focused under Satya Nadella, and he is also making some key changes to improve the culture.","Many layers of management.  In my experience (9 years) the management is generally weak when it comes to focusing on the output of the team and employee development.  Managers seem to pay more attention to pleasing their superiors. 

The other major drawback is the culture of competition between individuals, a legacy of the old review system.  That stack ranking/forced curve system is gone, but culture does not change as quickly as one would hope."
13169,Microsoft,Microsoft Office,2015-01-05,3.0,Senior User Experience Researcher,Professional working environment. Highly competitive culture. Focus on productivity. Rewards for outstanding performance. Broad scope of influence. Strategic products and services. Good benefits and total compensation package.,In transition from a business focused on software development to a business that runs a service. A lot of turnover and churn in management and reorgs. Lack of senior leadership vision and customer focus. Too dependent on enterprise business to focus resources on winning consumer's hearts and minds. Cannot win the loyalty of 21 year old and younger generation.
