131,NIH,Dream Team/ A-Team!!,2021-06-29,5.0,Analyst,"I started November 23rd of last year. I was looking at the fact that this job was a 10 mnt drive from my pad. I will say that I did not think I would get the job because it is the NIH. I will say I glad I did not realize how MAJOR this agency is. Fast forward, beast the two interview process and here I am 7 months later. I can see why this office has a two round interview process as well. Onboarding was smooth and I made sure I had all of my documents to avoid issues. As for doing my job itself- I thoroughly enjoy it. I am not use to being in such a collegial environment. The training that was given to me was so involved and in depth. I was intimidated because of the fact I am in a new job and agency. Currently, everything is fantastic. Fantastic team, supervisor and team lead. It has made such an astronomical difference in how I feel and causes me to push harder and stand out. It has been a major confidence booster because I am doing different stuff that I would have NEVER done in my old agency . Everyone works well and the morale is high. I credit that to my supervisor, team lead and the overall leadership in ES. It feels like I am in school because I am learning so much. Our opinions are valued and we all get feedback regarding our work. In the case of this office, I see why there is not a turnover which reflects so well on ES leadership. For me to leave this office, it would have to be equally as on par regarding work environment and quality of life. I will say I have the best of both worlds. I can wake up and not be stressed out and just feeling useless. Incredibly happy here and hoping to grow more and more 🙂!!",Nothing to report for downsides excluding the typical governmental policies.
132,NIH,Life as an SRO,2021-09-09,5.0,Scientific Review Officer,Broader perspective on science. Feel like I'm contributing to the peer review mission.,"I can't do my own research. Officially, I have no scientific opinions, as I'm ""Lady Justice"" in supervising the peer review process"

136,NIH,Division of Police: Old and Lazy Workforce,2021-10-08,1.0,Police Officer,"The NIH Police is one of the few Federal Law Enforcement departments where there is an emphasis on patrol duties. There are no stationary posts, like a lot of 0083 Police jobs in the DC Metro area.

Also, the schedule is very flexible and rarely do Officers have to do forced overtime.","Most of the workforce consists of older, retired Police from local agencies that are simply looking to collect a paycheck and a second retirement. Most are disinterested in doing actual Police work and prefer to do only the minimum amount of work necessary. The few Officers that are motivated to grow the department and change the status quo are constantly ignored by the command staff. Dispatchers are also extremely unprofessional and constantly provide incorrect or incomplete information to Officers. 

Training is also a complete mess. When new Officers start, they sit behind a computer for months waiting to be sent to the academy. The ones that lateral over from other agencies also have to wait for months to start Field Training. There is basically no standardized system for new hires. 

Furthermore, equipment and vehicles used are subpar. Many Officers are forced to go on patrol without ballistics vests, simply because they don't get fitted for one or wait for many months for theirs to arrive. The patrol vehicles are also basically falling apart. Every week, it seems a vehicle has to be taken to the shop and doesn't get fixed for several months. The department is full of higher ranking Lieutenants and Majors, but no one is held accountable. Most Officers that are younger leave and get hired with better agencies."

I have been at the NIH for more than 20 years. NIH has an incredibly important mission for the country and world, and is a great place for some people - but if you want to last here, and not become incredibly discouraged and jaded, that mission has to be enough for you. Good bosses are almost nonexistent (I've never had one in 20 years - but I've had some nightmarish ones), and NIH leadership doesn't care a whit about true leadership. Only very rarely are bad apples fired, and NIH was embarrassingly late to the game in terms of cracking down on harassment and improving diversity (women, minorities, etc.). People, especially yes-women in their 30s, are HIGHLY valued and groomed for very high level positions (that they're not nearly qualified for). White men are also valued. At the same time, there are many hardworking women over 50 who are invisible. GS-15s are expected to die on the vine...
So, if you have a PhD and are thinking about a career outside of the lab, think very carefully before going to the NIH - unless having a series of terrible bosses and pay that will top out long before you retire isn't going to bother you."

Institutes are siloed and do not learn from each other.  No recourse for bullying and harassment from managers."
564,NIH,"Really depends on the office, organization or Institute/Center",2012-05-28,4.0,Grant Review,"Has prestige attached to it. Name recognition, largest agency under DHHS. NIHers are looked upon favorably; helps for when/if you want to look outside the agency for opportunities. A lot of opportunities for non-scientific staff. Great mission, especially if you care about public health.","I unfortunately and unknowingly landed in an organization under the Office of the Director that is not very reputable and the staff is treated as such. Now that I'm in I am scrambling to try and get out and get a better position in an Institute. Even the Center my organization supports is kind of dead-end. A lot of the scientists are only there because their labs lost funding and it is the easiest way into NIH. There is even high turnover among them as they look for greener pastures within the agency. For the admin staff the work is very boring, there is not nearly enough of it and has a narrow focus on something that no one outside of the Center cares about so it is hard to gain transferable skills. They want highly experienced professionals for entry level work. Again, this applies to my organization which is actually being disbanded and merged into the Institutes and Centers it supports. I still want to go to another Institute because there aren't that many opportunities for admin staff at this Center.

The Grade levels are very low for both scientists and admin and of course there is the usual bureaucracy."
