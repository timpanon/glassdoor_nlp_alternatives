1,Qualtrics,Amazing,2022-04-02,5.0,Technical Account Manager,"Absolutely amazing, greatest people, talented teams, great offices. Actually enjoy coming into the office!","There are no cons, greatest place to work!"
2,Qualtrics,"Amazing team, leaders & a winning product!",2022-02-18,5.0,Customer Success Manager,"The people at Qualtrics, and especially in Customer Success, are the absolute best. Super bright, low-ego, and so supportive. I have the best bosses (would not consider another company while I have them kind of bosses), an awesome team and love everyone I work with. 

I've been supported, given stretch opportunities and feel like I haven't stopped growing since I've gotten here. I plan to be at Qualtrics for the long-term.

I am confident in the company direction and ability to win; it's an exciting space and fun technology. I really enjoy getting to talk to my clients and help them with the tech and services we provide. Great opportunity to geek out a few times a day :) 

Customer Success can be a challenging job, but I feel very supported by the company and after being here several years have seen Qualtrics take action on processes that were not designed well and caused customer/employee frustration. No software company has perfect products and systems (hello, job security for customer success managers everywhere :P), so it will never be a frustration-free job but I love being at Qualtrics and highly recommend it to everyone!","Just normal customer success cons, it's a great job to develop transferrable skills and enter software but navigating conflict can be draining at times."
3,Qualtrics,A big company that's still got it!,2022-02-25,5.0,Technology Consultant II,"I have always worked with amazing people but the people at Qualtrics are top-notch! This has to be the best thing so far.

The $1,200 a year wellness stipend is awesome. You can use it on anything that is geared toward wellness. 

There is a big focus on career development from the second you start. They are dedicated to getting you to where you want to go.

Landing on the right team is important at Qualtrics. Some teams are better than others. But if you get hired, consider yourself to be top-notch. There is a lot that goes into the hiring process.","The pay is competitive but not above market averages. Although there are ample opportunities for promotions, bonuses, etc if you work hard and are committed. There are timelines you have to meet for promotions though which is a bummer if you are performing very well."
4,Qualtrics,Extremely happy with joining Qualtrics,2022-02-15,5.0,Technology Consultant,"1. Amazing people managers who listen and help you set & meet goals and define your career trajectory

2. You have the people and tools around you to do your job

3. The work is interesting and very relevant for businesses

4. Great culture - everyone is so nice and helpful and the people working here often align very well with the overall company values/initiatives

5. A lot of opportunity to get involved with different parts of the business if you want. Even more opportunity for internal projects and improvement as well if you are in a period of reduced client work.

6. Benefits and pay are perfectly fine with me for a company as big as Qualtrics. There are a lot of perks that have been introduced recently that are super helpful. 

Bonus: Many people not coming from a company that actually provides its own software probably do not realize that the platform doesn't have very many major issues with it when implementing it.","1. As always, when working with clients, you can encounter scope creep & poorly defined or overpromised program objectives/deliverables

2. Again, not specific to Qualtrics itself, but juggling clients is an on-going challenge (pivoting between projects & meetings, client expectation mgmt, etc.)."
5,Qualtrics,Decent opportunities if you go eyes wide open,2022-02-11,3.0,Senior Product Marketing Manager,Get to work on a lot of different things and be exposed to many professional learning opportunities,"Bad diversity equity and inclusion. The company is very white, very Mormon and it’s absolutely a “boys / Mormon club” at the top of the company. 

Also faced antisemitism in a few instances directly as well as through the broader Utah community. Of course it’s not every person at all, but it’s enough that it impacted my experience. 

A lot of chaos and difficulties transitioning from a mid size company into an enterprise size public firm. 

Lacking senior leadership vision, very inconsistently applied other than hype and kook aid. 

There is a culture of celebrating those that put out fires but not those that are planners. 

Burn out is real. 

Qualtrics has some nice benefits for sure but there’s also a bit of a meet the bare minimum to be  able to say “us too!” With other tech companies. Then the leadership team pats themselves on the back for days."

* Company-wide North Star projects to improve architecture are clear and inspired

* Ryan Smith (founder) is cringe
* Stock is a big part of comp and a bit volatile
* 401K matching is low
* Expect tech debts; engineering quality is inconsistent
* PMs follow customer requests blindly and don't have long-term vision of what the product should look like in a couple years
* Sells directly to companies that have representatives within the company, so expect escalation of tickets when the customer is blocked; if you like direct feedback from customers it might be a pro but I find some customers annoying"

- The promotion process can be a popularity contest at times 
- Work life balance can be poor
- Talent retention (consistent turnover was an issue)
- Pay can be below market depending on the team

Overall, Qualtrics will be just fine. People will come, and people will go. However, in my honest opinion, if you're moving your entire life to Utah in order to work here... really consider that this will probably be a 2 year stop for you. Maybe 3. This can be great if you're starting your career, but it might not be worth uprooting your life for mid-career. Up to you."

17,Qualtrics,Great Place to work part time during school,2022-03-14,5.0,"Software Engineer, Part Time",This is a great place to get your first exposure to software engineering.,There doesn't seem to be much opportunity for promotion internally if you work part time.
18,Qualtrics,Excessively Average Work Culture,2022-02-15,2.0,Anonymous Employee,They do try to expand their benefits every year even if the expansions are minimal.,"Despite selling that they are a unique company to work for, they are very run-of-the-mill corporate status quo. They are only ""people first"" focused when it comes to how they market themselves as an employer. When you get behind the scenes it's not at all true. They think of employees as investments, not people, and they treat you as such. Their supposedly unique performance and promotion review cycles are just stack ranking with some extra frills to try to hide it. If you don't mind the average corporate working experience you'll probably be fine here, though you could probably find plenty of other places with the same work culture that will pay you more. If you want a place that's actually unique and focused on employee well-being don't be lured in by their well-tailored branding."

23,Qualtrics,"Awful pay, convoluted product, little transparency. Do not recommend.",2022-03-18,1.0,Technical Account Manager,"Many people you meet will be smart and amicable. If you don't mind living in Utah (with its lack of diversity and its Mormon bent), the Provo office is kind of cool, with a small garden, open floor plan, and lots of space.","The compensation and benefits component is a HARD 1 out of 5. Qualtrics is notorious for paying below market rate. In every single role I know of, including my own, people are underpaid compared to the industry, role, and other companies, even if you factor in location. Just FYI, Provo is becoming a higher COL area and yet Qualtrics' salary bands don't even meet industry standard either. 

If you ask your managers about this or give them feedback, they may listen but they'll go to the compensation team and then the compensation team will give them BS back about how they find a ""market reference point"", yada yada. Change does not fee like it's going to happen. This is ironic, given that two of the literal company values are one team and transparency.

Global operations (where TAMs and ""product specialists"", aka Quni aka grunt customer support work, live) is a horrible department to work in unless you're ok with below market pay and really enjoy never-ending work of triaging client issues AND being client-facing. Honestly, the product specialist job is one of the worst ones out there – it's volume-based and metric-driven based on how many support tickets you take per day and what your customer satisfaction (CSAT) score is, which is not totally under your control. And they hire for bright people for this product specialist role, which is just a waste of their potential in a stressful, thankless job. TAM is similar in still being client-facing and client-supporting, and a lot of the TAM team is burnt out.

Qualtrics overall has been an extremely disappointing place to work, and underwhelming for the company that claims to be ""the experience management company"". I definitely want to say more, but it's hard to capture everything I hate about working here, although I'm glad that some of it has been captured in the other recent one-star reviews, which you should go read!

The last thing I'll say is that if Qualtrics GENUINELY wants to become ""tHe dEsTinaTion WorKpLacE"", then it NEEDS to embrace remote work, transparency, and higher pay with a healthy salary growth potential, and lose some (really, a LOT) of its corporate veneer that is very obviously and grossly driven toward maximizing profit."

-The kind of place where if you don't like what is happening you have a chance to change it. There is so much growth and so much to be done that leadership embraces people who see a problem and want to make sure that it gets fixed. 

- The Leadership really practice what they preach and want to ensure every employee has a positive experience at Q. There are plenty of things that are a work in progress but they are listening and trying.

- Fast paced, high growth and easy to believe in the future of the company. Anyone with strong work ethic and even basic talent has opportunity for upward trajectory.

- My team has great work life balance which is really stressed as part of our org culture. Not all organizations have this however.","- Rapid growth leads to constant operational gaps with new ones being created all the time and the old ones becoming more and more painful as time passes. There are teams working to fix these but too often leadership does not channel sufficient resources to these efforts until things reach critical mass. Which can be frustrating for impacted teams.

- Recruiting is slammed with all of the rapid hiring and it can be left up to managers to source their own candidates and move people through the hiring process. This can create a poor experience for candidates and employees alike.

- Family leave benefits are far behind the industry standard. It makes it hard to attract and retain Women who are in demand at all tech companies right now."

Good people around you, except a majority of sales leadership are good old boys that can be narrow minded because Qualtrics is the only place they have ever worked.

Very good for your resume.","Old boys club with how you are set up for success in sales. Over hiring of sales reps. They have stated in group meetings that 40% of reps hitting is a success metric. Majority of top reps and leadership are people who have been at Qualtrics for several years and their success is dependent upon their timing and territories. This leaves many managers with major skill gaps when attempting to set you up for success. As well as a big problem of people being narrow minded and their britches being too big for them.

Sales and cross functional departments do not play well together. Sales are seen as a necessary evil and are treated as such when bringing in other departments into deals. I have seen some very bad sales behavior so this could be a result of that.

Terrible departure experience. I gave a month's notice when I was leaving. I never received any outreach from corporate or anyone other than folks that I had worked with that were wishing me the best. No exit survey, no exit interview, nothing. Even though we sell this. The only contact I ever received from Qualtrics was a legal letter threatening me against taking employees to where I was going, etc."

What has stood out to me so far:
- The genuine push from everyone at all levels to be transparent about how decisions are made, what the company is doing well and what the company needs to improve on.
- Senior leadership sets diversity, equity and inclusion goals for the year (hiring, promotions within the company, etc.) and actually tracks and reports how we are doing against those goals.
- Leadership uses our own product to collect feedback to determine what areas need to be improved and then actually acts on that feedback. Shows that they truly believe in the product while also making employees feel heard.","I'm sure there are some out there, but I haven't run into any cons yet!"
42,Qualtrics,"Great vision, but losing out on talent",2022-02-08,3.0,Principal Analyst,"Great culture on a lot of teams. Great vision. Great opportunity for strong growth, with strong equity compensation. Great opportunities to choose your location. Work-life balance can be okay if you're on the right team and defend your space. I've loved a lot of the people. Hiring executives who have a great vision for the future and are progressively moving there.","Company is still burdened with a ""sales bro"" culture. Feels like it's a sales-first company, built around helping sales reps get the biggest paychecks possible. Even people in roles that are very not sales roles are still pushed to ""get in front of customers"" and be involved in deals. Sales revenue is one of the only metrics used, anywhere in the company, to measure performance. Sales org is definitely more important to Qualtrics than product / engineering. 

Qualtrics talks a big game on winning talent, but it's losing. Real talent planning doesn't happen. Qualtrics salaries were already lower than competitors, but 2022 salary updates were half the inflation rate and lagged far behind industry-wide salary growth in 2021. Despite efforts to improve benefits, medical coverage is worse in 2022 than it was in 2021. Little or no paths or opportunities to grow or progress in your career without leaving the company. Very little support for learning, growth, or development. Learning is dependent on either switching roles periodically or being lucky and having one of the rare managers who is good at coaching/mentoring.

Qualtrics is working on a lot of these things, but the company is also going to hemorrhage employees unless they fix some of these problems fast."

- Attention to employee engagement within the company.

- Competitive pay and benefits.","- Struggles a lot with legacy codebase, and management seems to focus more on satisfying the customer with new features than addressing the outdated architecture.

- Promotion and leveling requirements are absurd. An engineer has to act at the next level for a year (could have changed recently though) before actually being promoted to the next level. Why should someone continuously act beyond their job description for a chance at a promotion to make that their official responsibility?

- Touch and go on a per-team basis, but documentation tends to be lacking so ramp-up can be very rough. Engineers operate on a lot of tribal knowledge and person-to-person knowledge transfer."

- Great opportunity there - XM to the moon!","- the DEI culture can feel exclusive at times, not inclusive - there's definitely a feeling that if you don't think a certain way, you aren't welcome. It's arguably not just a feeling - one guy shared an idea that wasn't in the mainstream and he got severely attacked (verbally) by a ton of people across the company. I felt terrible for him, and also decided I'd just keep my mouth shut if I ever have a political idea that is different from the mainstream.

They are working to reduce this friction but still needs a lot of work to simplify processes. 

Pay levels are determined in a pretty arbitrary way despite the hiring rubric they use, and what is needed for promotions is not always a clear path. Mobility between departments is always lateral at most, and sometimes constitutes a pay cut conceptually speaking."

You will definitely learn a lot. Qualtrics is also very supportive of changing roles (flexibility to move around company) and of personal growth.,"Qualtrics preaches the ultimate employee experience yet they don't exactly practice that. There's hardly nothing that's competitive about their benefits/compensation package, in fact it's subpar in some ways. They severely underpay their entry level employees by $10-$15k making it hard to ever reach an average salary. For a lot of entry level roles, they have a pretty standardized salary that's non negotiable so just know what you're getting into.

Reviews and promotions are very systematic but fair IMO. While it can be a bit of a daunting process it also provides a clear path and method to promote which I appreciate after coming from a couple startups.

112,Qualtrics,A Glorified Call Center,2021-07-19,1.0,Software Sales Development Representative,"Experience in Salesforce, ZoomInfo, and Outreach. Some good coworkers.","Qualtrics is a glorified call center. From the moment I was hired, the only thing I was good for was the calls, opportunities, and pipeline I generated for my team. I was encouraged to work overtime if I was not where I needed to be, even if that meant working on the weekends. There was no work/life balance while being an SDR at this company.

There was also no team atmosphere amongst my team- it was every SDR for themselves. While other departments were different from mine, I was in a vertical that was not doing as well and that stress fell on the SDRs. 

The training at this company was only two weeks. After said training, we were then thrown on the phones with little to say. My advice would be to extend the training and allow SDRs to ask questions and feel comfortable before they start calling outbound.

Some managers at this company are new to management and it shows. Find managers who have past experience in leading teams and know how to correctly uplift their coworkers."

Products regularly rolled out in a haphazard manner with no thought to value of said product nor position in the company portfolio and greater survey tool market. 

Cult of Qualtrics is strong. Hive mind mentality and grind/hustle culture leads to top down pressure for strong forecast calls when pipeline truly does not exist. 

Overall headcount and leadership dominated by specific EOCC class.

Everyone I've worked with has seemed intrinsically motivated and do well for themselves in terms of getting more responsibilities or career growth opportunities, so it's nice to see people promote internally. There is a culture of accountability, which I personally think is nice, especially at the senior leadership level.","A lot of the less positive aspects about working here are about bureaucracy or lack of communication between departments, but I think overall this is the best it gets for a corporate work environment. Not necessarily a con, but be warned - this is not the place you want to be if you want to ""rest and vest"" regardless of what position or level you hold. There's a lot of talented and hard workers here, so you really have to earn your keep (promos and bonuses). I wish they'd just opt for full-time remote work at this point."

122,Qualtrics,"Inexperienced Engineering Managers, Tech Leads, and horrible OKR system caused a clinical depression diagnosis",2021-11-30,1.0,Software Engineer II,"""XM"" means ""Experience Management"" not ""Experienced Managers""","During my almost 3 three year tenure at Qualtrics, I had 4 managers and 3 tech leads.

Each manager was less experienced than the last. Each tech lead was less experienced than the last.

Promotions were based on who showed the most promise. Not who completed the best or most effort consistently. Close to zero data was used to make these promotion decisions.

The quarterly 360 performance review system is a complete joke. The OKR system is broken. 

I went through 10 review cycles at Qualtrics. During the first three, I was exceeding or meeting expectations. As time went on, the expectations of output grew wildly. Every quarter you just stretch your OKRs to exceed your own performance from your previous quarter, even if you are meeting expectations. By the time of my 6th review cycle, almost two years into my role, my responsibilities on my team grew by a multiple of ten. Yet, I was held to a much higher bar because five previous stretch goal quarters had been ""meeting expectations"".  After quarter #6, my mental health had declined beyond self-repair due to this incredibly soul-destroying system. I disclosed my clinical depression diagnosis to my direct manager. He shrugged it off and did not discuss my options with me. It didn't affect his trajectory after all, right? Aaaah, I can smell the Amazon from here. Anyway, due to this morbidly terrible goal-setting system they have, due to the garbage dump of a management team, I became unable to stretch my goals further. The following two quarters I became an ""under performer"" while holding over triple the responsibilities in my job role than the day I was hired. By my 9th quarterly review, working the hardest I have ever worked for a company in my life, I was placed on a PIP due to purposefully saying ""No"" to further day-to-day responsibility requests from management.

I left my role clinically depressed, an alcoholic, and with imposter syndrome that affected the trajectory of my career in a hugely negative way.

If you are a New Grad looking for a job, avoid Qualtrics at all costs. For your own good. Beware. 

If you are a mid-level engineer looking for a new role, go work for Amazon. Same management experience, better pay.

As I am submitting this review for a role I left in 2019, I am happy to report I have recovered from my depression caused by my job at Qualtrics. Two years later, in 2021."

144,Qualtrics,Customer Support,2021-10-04,1.0,Customer Success Manager,"Qualtrics itself is a very cool company: lots of perks for coming into the office, free swag, etc. The people they attract are exceptionally bright and eager to do the job well. Outside of Customer Success, I can imagine that the company would be a good (if not great) place to work.","Where do I begin? 

To start, this role, Customer Success Manager, should really be called customer support. Unless you’re an MBA hire, good luck getting your customers to want to discuss anything other than their support issues. Don’t think because “I came from I banking/consulting that this won’t be the situation for me”: trust me, we all came from that same background and this is how the job works. 

You are the bearer of bad news for all things related to your customer This is a job where there are literal unsolvable problems and it is the Customer Success Managers job to tell the customer that not only is their problem legitimate, but that there is no way to solve it without them spending money. Qualtrics refuses to move the extra inch to see if they can help their customers spending hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. If the company isn’t a “cool” brand, good luck finding any additional resources.

This job is all about how much more you can sell. Each quarter you are required to expand your book of business by X dollars (different per level). It’s almost the same amount as an AE without the perk of commission and the expectation to be a strategic partner (aka support rep) with your customers. You could be the most strategic, phenomenal CSM at Qualtrics and get average ratings if you don’t sell.

You work with very new/low-level support reps who refuse to help you or the customer and make the job just about impossible to accomplish. 

While they may say they are always willing to help, I have found minimal support from my manager and they don’t seem to care about their people at all more than on a friend-to-friend level.

Also, the pay is average at best. They boast about the low cost of living, but really PROVO has a low cost of living. If you want to be in a non-LDS area, it’s a very high cost of living (plus an hour+ commute to the office).

Lastly, it’s very much so a culture of get on board or get out from the C-suite. Make sure you’re ready for some brainwashy comments when you accept your offer."

- I've been at the company for less than a year and my feedback has already been put into action (Company is open for change)","- Processes take longer than needed (Qualtrics grew pretty quickly, so it makes sense that processes were put in place but a lot of them are unnecessary) Can take up to 4 days to get something approved. Good news is that they recognize this (probably through the employee feedback channel I mentioned) and are actually taking action to change

157,Qualtrics,Great business outlook. Increasingly difficult/challenging place to work,2021-07-09,3.0,Customer Success,"Qualtrics is thriving and still has a long way to go in terms of growth. We're well-positioned as a leader in our category. Working for an industry leader has many perks on its own. Our customers are some of the most emblematic brands in the world. That's something you won't miss at Qualtrics, which was important for me coming from a top-tier consulting firm.

Compensation is competitive and it's great to see a shift towards helping employees feel ownership by awarding equity as compensation.

Perks and benefits are fairly standard for any good tech company. Although our health insurance has gotten significantly worse since I started here.

Our founder is also the Utah Jazz owner, so we occasionally get to attend games. The Qualtrics suite if you're lucky.

Finally, the experience bonus is one of the most unique things here. You get a $1,500 annual bonus that can only be spent on an experience. It gets people to try new things or travel to new places.

We are making a lot of improvements on the DEI front. It's always discussed in our leadership meetings.","Work-life balance is something we pay a lot of lip service to, but that keeps getting worse. It's a pretty intense job and it feels like you're on-call all the time. That's weekends, vacations, out sick, etc. 

Remote work is also going away, partially. There have been clear indications from senior leadership that there's some lack of trust in our ability to continue to operate effectively without coming to the office regularly. This one stings.

There are some serious growing pains we're experiencing after the IPO. A shift at the senior level management towards short term profitability and quarterly earnings. We talked a lot about this prior to the IPO, how being a public company wouldn't change us and we shouldn't let the IPO distract us. It fees like our brand and values are getting dilluted in the pursuit of growth. 

I'm not sure whether it's related to the IPO/SAP Acquisiton or not, but benefits have gotten more expensive, promotions are rarer than ever and it's very political. I hated a lot of what I had to do to be promoted and wouldn't do it again. We've also gotten clunkier in our execution. Some of it is CYA now that we're a public company, but a lot of it is run-of-the-mill corporate red tape.

Our values, culture, and products used to be what attracted and kept people here. Now, it's more comon to hear money and the vesting of equity shares as the main reason to stick around. After many years here, it's very sad to see."

It’s purely a sales and marketing company led by the boys club in Provo. Decisions are made - and changed regularly- by the leadership and inputs from rank and file ignored. The reality is that the business is a bubble ripe for popping. It’s a survey company that the leadership has sold its customers on a vision they can’t execute on. (Even SAP bought into this before realizing the truth and selling the company)

Once the company gets you in with competitive pay, don’t expect any significant increases. Promotions are hard to come by - a tedious and embarrassing process that makes you beg to your colleagues for recommendations when you want a promotion. Once you get it - the compensation increase is normally < 5%.

Management gives lip service to employee experience, but really has very little respect for employees. Employees are replaceable and looked down upon.

Quality of life varies significantly depending on where you are in the company and who your manager is.
Career growth is strictly regimented, with minimal opportunity to progress faster than their ""plan"".

174,Qualtrics,"Great place to start your career, but probably look elsewhere to grow",2021-07-24,3.0,Software Engineer II,"1. At least the team(s) that I was on, you really get to have hands-on experience with the technologies that you're consuming and using to develop software. Whereas some other companies may have many a blackbox that encapsulate a lot of the ""magic"" away, at Qualtrics you get to work on software engineering in its entirety - from designing the product/service to setting up the CICD pipelines to writing the code to building out the corresponding suite of unit/integration tests to configuring alerting/metrics.

2. Opportunity to work with highly intelligent and capable engineers some of which are thousands of miles away from you. This is especially true since I worked during 2020, but it's even more true when you realize that Qualtrics has engineering offices in the US, PL, and UK. It's amazing, and some of my best interactions were with individuals > 5000 miles away from me.

3. Stock options. While the pay is extremely mediocre, the stock options were really beneficial, especially given Quatrics' background (acquired by SAP then subsequently IPO).","1. Obvious variance in the performance of its engineering organization, especially as it applies to higher level engineers and managers. I am sure other companies have issues when it comes to performance evaluations but oh boy is this the case at Qualtrics. Most I know just work at Qualtrics long enough and surely you will be rewarded; certainly, this reflects a tenure to merit mentality that you will notice runs rampant throughout the company. Some L4/L5/L6's are getting paid wayyyyy too much for doing absolutely trivial/mediocre work.

2. Lack of focus at the management level. I am a bit surprised looking back at how disconnected my manager was from my team in terms of truly knowing what/how our product works and consequently what to focus on in subsequent quarters.

3. Tendency to hire in instead of incubating home grown talent. I've heard stories of some engineers being hired in as an L4, for example, and months later, an L5 is hired in even though the two worked at the same company before and started at the same time. Qualtrics, having an engineering office in Seattle, absolutely loves to hire in ex Microsoft/Amazon/Goldman Sachs since having a history with these companies somehow suggest that you're technically fit for a role at Qualtrics.

4. Lack of diversity. It's extremely difficult to attract talent to the Provo, UT office. The reputation of this state/location precedes it, which is why a non-trivial amount of employees come straight from BYU. Go cougars :D 

5. In general, unqualified individuals in leadership positions. No elaboration needed on this."

The benefits and mobility are okay, but you have to stay in for a while to see those come to fruition. If you go to the office, there is free food, which is nice.","Upper management wields a lot of power and is very disconnected from probably one of the most crucial roles that make Qualtrics what it is. As a result, you're essentially being exploited as they pile more responsibilities onto you. I was told by someone from upper management that ""we only hire the best, and the grind is worth it for upward mobility"", but after seeing so many changes to the company and salaries being lowered significantly and benefits are being revised, that argument doesn't hold up. 

There are specialists who are bilingual and are forced to work twice as hard without incentive because the company initiatives on recruiting multilingual speakers fall short. While there is more initiative, the burden still relies heavily on those specialists as training takes more time, and it's rather unfair to see this happen with some of my colleagues.

If you make it out of this position, kudos to you! The metrics system and added expectations and forced overtime will stretch you thin, and you will be burnt out. You will feel ashamed for not meeting metrics whether it's intentional or not; it takes a toll on your mental health and you will still feel bad if you take time off because you'll feel you're making it worse for your colleagues by adding more to their workload. Don't let the phrases on ""having to grind"" in order to see the payoff make you feel lazy or like you're not doing enough.

This job pulls you in with the illusion that you will be able to collaborate on projects with other teams, and have so many opportunities to pick up new skills and badges, but this couldn't be further from the truth. Because of capacity, you will become a ticket taking machine, and will not have those opportunities unless it is an extreme case, and even then you will be limited. In addition, you don't really have a healthy work/life balance as they say. It's rather disappointing to be sold on that, and having that opportunity taken away. 

The company is not diverse, but they are striving for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion which is good. However their recruiting and hiring efforts are still rooted in meritocracy and bias, and it's a shame because these hiring standards largely exclude minorities and less privileged groups who would otherwise be great for this role but don't meet the unnecessarily high standards due to systematic injustices in place. This job isn't really hard in terms of material, and many can be trained to use the platform and become proficient in it to offer support. You don't have to be a college graduate from UCLA and graduate Magna Cum Laude for this role, and you are more than likely overqualified for this position.

For a company that prides itself on and sells products that try to improve Employee Experiences and Engagement, it's rather ironic and sad that there is quite a bit of employee dissatisfaction and little action is being taken."

Qualtrics has changed the bonus, commission, and promotion structure more times than I count. It always benefits the same types of people and prevents others from succeeding.

All of the sales department are men with stay at home wives who have too much plastic surgery, too many children, and drive luxury SUVs. They give men a week of paternal leave, which that tells you what they think of men and women’s roles. 

Even the men who are not LDS have had to be whistleblowers on fraudulent activities and sketchy deals involving white Mormon men. The only thing that came out of it was that the white Mormon men who were reported received promotions and went to Bora Bora for free with their spouses. 

The company’s expectations to sell a useless software is extremely unrealistic and no resources are given. No quota changes even with a global pandemic.  They had people try to give a free survey when COVID hit in the spring, and then couldn’t understand why there wasn’t any sales. 

There is no flexibility and don’t allow people to work from home normally. They don’t pay for your wifi or cell phone. They keep raising the bar for promotions and adding more levels, while promoting their white Mormon men for no reason at all. If you’re not part of the LDS church, stay far, far away. If you aren’t down for misogyny or nepotism, stay far away. You have been warned."

Unrealistic hours/workloads have been put on project management teams.
- Upward mobility is dependent on ""quadrant performance"", expect a lot of micro-managing and a lot of hard work on your end
- Lots of promotion requirements are set unrealistically high in order for internal teams to buy time to fully vet out the promotion process for multiple verticals. You will have to fight for what you want and your ""internal brand"" will always be a factor. Be nice to your managers cuz that's about all the help you get. At least, this is from my experience working through the SDR, AE and Brand Expert career tracks.
- It took a pandemic for Qualtrics to actually consider a work from home policy. Even now we don't have a full program in place. You are required to work in the office 3 days a week.

226,Qualtrics,re:  Good company with strong culture/executive leaders...sales could be tough,2021-04-28,3.0,Enterprise Account Executive,"There is really a good culture with the TACOS theme. The leadership brings a lot of good energy, ideas, and enthusiasm which bleeds throughout the organization. Sales is a good spot to start in and then migrate to other positions in the company. There really is a strong team mentality. Management does offer a lot of support to be successful. I fortunately did well and had a good book of business. There is good money to be made in the software side. The money isn't as lucrative on the services side. Overall a good software company and good company to be a part of. They try to be transparent with weekly leadership calls. It's a younger organization as many of the sales people, it's their first jobs out of college.","Given it's a heavy data company, there is a lot of data that leadership uses to micromanage the job. There is a big emphasis on the Gartner quadrant and there is much pressure for sales to be ""top right"". The quadrant leads to a lot of time doing mindless mining and wasted time that could be devoted to sales. Burnout is real in the sales development role and account executive. The culture could be a bit cultish created heavily by the boys club in Provo. Career advancement is a bit slower once there as there is a rigid model--have to mentor, pod lead, etc. It's frustrating especially when one has the experience already. There is a lot of rah-rah which could seem scripted."
227,Qualtrics,Fast-Moving,2020-09-05,4.0,Learning Experience Designer,"- Company Culture: Lots of excitement and growth, emphasis on TACOs values, and groups to join to advocate for greater diversity, inclusion, etc.
- Pay/Benefits: For my role, I am paid comparatively well and am very pleased with the benefits, from health to bonuses (e.g., the experience bonus each year).
- Not a Boring Moment: If you enjoy staying busy and having multiple projects at once, then you might enjoy the fast-paced nature of the work here.","- Lack of Work-Life Balance: This may depend on the team, but the work is demanding and employees can take ""all in"" too far (e.g., meetings all day, 50-60 hour weeks, working evenings/weekends). From my perspective, it is often not sustainable and leads to burnout and high turnover.
- Inefficient or Nonexistent Processes: Though we pride ourselves on being ""scrappy,"" this often means that processes within and between team are not well-defined. This can be a frustrating and surprising experience, and I marvel that some things get done - attributing it to the high caliber of people working here, not to the processes.
- Competitive Bonus/Promotion Process: The system for determining bonus levels and promotions puts people in the same team against each other. Qualtrics hires such high performers that this can be a discouraging process for some."

The people are some of the best I have had the privilege to work with. People are not looking to cut you down, instead the teams are constantly trying to build you up and offer support where you need it.","Honestly - micro-management and aggressive sales tactics. That is my biggest gripe. You have to meet certain expectations in order to be deemed successful. The leadership team requires a lot of data from its reps (and I get why), however, it can become a beating when you are more worried about the number of calls you made instead of looking for quality deals that will convert. Quantity takes place over quality. It's also uncomfortable when leadership is demanding that we push a decision to be made and in some cases going 

The other issue as of late has been with the territory changes. As we align with our parent company the account books have changed drastically and made it even more difficult to land those big accounts.

Despite all this I will say that I have felt support from leadership in our office to make things better. They are trying and that's what matters."
235,Qualtrics,Look elsewhere. Terrible culture.,2020-11-02,2.0,Senior Project Manager,Fairly well paid. Decent benefits. Relatively good opportunities to move up.,"Huge lack of transparency from senior leaderships. Changes sprung upon employees w/o notice. One minute we’re acquired by SAP, next minute being spun. No insider info shared. No info on employee equity. Everything shared with employees was shared publicly with press.

Company is shockingly vertical. Lower level employees aren’t privileged/trusted with info about strategic company objectives. All decisions are made top-down. Opinions are not sought and actively ignored. Qualtrics cares only that employees are “happy” but doesn’t treat lower-level lower employees with respect, solicit their opinions, or consult them before making job-impacting changes. If you’re used to being at a company were anyone can schedule 30 minutes with a senior leader, flee! It’s NOT that way here. Lower level employees are not valued.

Company focuses on sales quotas over perfecting product. Big sales bro culture.

Free lunch 3 days a week, on-site gym, beautiful 5-acre grounds, bring your dog to work, etc. None of that has existed for over a year now so any pros have gone away with WFH.","Benefits has continued stalling around our questions for what benefits we will have post-SAP as well as denying any requests for reimbursement of internet, lunches (considering we used to get 3 free meals a week and one subsidized), and any other expense that has skyrocketed since going fully remote. It’s extremely disappointing as we still advertise all of these benefits when recruiting even though it’s been 13 months since we’ve had them. 

Promotion paths are impossible. In my 2 years here I’ve seen a ton of frustrated coworkers with the antiquated promotion path that completely pigeonholes you if you’re not the #1 kiss a** of the team. I’ve seen too many talented colleagues quit citing this as the main reason.

Work life balance is nonexistent. Qualtrics is touted as a family friendly company, but only if your manager has kids. My manager had no empathy whatsoever for my situation when we started working from home while children also school from home. She expected more hours, which I gave up copious bedtime stories, continued working through lunches, and for months I even skipped dinners due to the workload being completely overwhelming. Despite this and working 60+ hours a week, delivering everything within the deadline, and continuing take on more than my role required, my manager slapped me with a rating of missed expectations. In a 6-month rating period she had one constructive conversation with me. If an employee is truly missing expectations then that should be the focus of bi-weekly 1:1’s. She referenced my inability to “balance” my personal life and work life. As a mom, this was the most offensive thing anyone could have said to me when for over a year I had sacrificed spending time with my children for work in the anticipation of receiving an aggressive promotion schedule. She ensured this would not happen and all of the reasons point to a personal issue with me rather than my work ethic and work output to blame. After raising this with HR as there was clear discrimination for having a family it was extremely clear that they were only here to protect the company and not me as the employee. They refused to acknowledge all of the data I brought to the table despite plenty of other working moms telling me I had a legitimate case I could take to a lawyer extremely easily. It’s sad that they don’t appreciate working moms like they say they do, or protect them at the very least. This rating came weeks after the head of people ops sent an email requesting managers be extremely understanding in this trying time for working parents. Juxtaposed with my rating letter and the nicest thing I can say is that my manager is completely tone deaf. This is obviously a very niche experience, but if you decide to work here as a parent DO NOT GO ONTO A TEAM WITH A MANAGER WITHOUT CHILDREN!!! You will find yourself working crazy overtime for someone who doesn’t care to understand your situation."

Boasts a meritocracy, but at its core, it's really not. There are checks in place that you must be in a certain level for a specified number of years before you can promote, management strategically gives people higher ratings if they are eligible for promotion, which is smart, but not a meritocracy.

Should be a month long training, at least, to compete with other tech sales organizations. If training was more applicable, SDRs could hit the ground running and be successful right out of the gate.
Technology for my job arrived late, had to use my own gear. No compensation for phone plan despite customers/prospects will call your personal phone number at any time of day. Had to ask how to get access to many tools I need in my everyday job.

286,Qualtrics,Very mixed rollercoaster,2020-10-13,3.0,Product Manager,"People here have been extremely supportive of my personal career development. This has been the primary reason for me staying at Qualtrics given the cons outlined below.

Our high growth environment means there are many personally fulfilling, high impact projects that lead to a fun workload.","TENURE BASED PROMOTION AND RATING SYSTEM. We tout being a meritocracy (to the point it was included in our prior S-1), but this is simply not true. You have to be in level for 2 years before becoming eligible for promotion (the promotion cycles are 6 months apart). By being in level 2 years, I literally mean 2 years - I started in October 2 years ago, the same month as the promotion cycles, but they cut off to the exact day so I'm not actually eligible. While there is an exception process, it is notoriously impossible to get through. Additionally, the rating system is also tenure based. For the first rating cycle, even if your boss tells you that you've outperformed expectations, are ramping extremely quickly, and delivering high impact, you can still only ever get ""meets expectations"" (my boss had directly told me she thought I deserved higher but couldn't give me anything other than meets since I was only 6 months into the job). Even more unfortunately, this has a direct impact eligibility for the exception process, enforcing the tenure based cycle.

The early indication is we're being ripped off in our share conversion ratio for going back into an independent company. 

Decisions are made by a small few in the organization.

No permenat WFH options. Post-COVID, this might be the straw that breaks my back and forces me to leave for somewhere else. 

Communication is lacking. For example, we've made a statement that we want to lead the industry in slowly returning to work. However, it's now 2 months from our return date and all the big tech companies have pushed out into mid-2021, yet there's been crickets on what our plan is. One of many examples. 

VERY political for a company of our size (this was the case pre-SAP). Biggest surprise."

294,Qualtrics,"I started before 2020 ""happened""",2020-06-23,5.0,Enterprise Account Executive,"I started at Qualtrics at the tail end of 2019, right around the holidays. Really great time to start as a sales rep, you get to take advantage of a fresh quota, ramp quota, holidays, good time for training, come into the new year with learning and conferences, its all excitement. But all that happened- it was actually crazy busy, books of business changed, teams adjusted a bit, then .... covid hit. We all know it's tough but all I have to say about this company amidst both the normalcy and craziness - is that the agility, understanding, momentum and energy of this company are second to none. I have never been at a place where sales reps are TOLD to sell free solutions. Obviously not a long term thing guys and we still had to sell actual dollas. But hear me out. We put out GENUINE solutions to help with COVID. Genuine. You know that thing every software sales rep tells themselves, their friends, and fam, so they can sleep at night? ""I love what I do because I believe in what I sell. We actually solve problems, we actually make a difference"" I am telling you as one of those people who says that BS -- 80% of the time it's just not the case. IT IS 100% TRUE HERE. Sometimes I don't believe how true it is. Like there aren't other motives. Being an employee at this company and seeing the response during a pandemic, both feeling my own needs met and that of my customers, gave me the utmost confidence in our future and the commitment I have to being here. Ryan Smith, the CEO, is also a no-nonsense guy. You see this guy roll around the office (pre covid of course) on a skateboard in hightops and a backwards cap and you're like ....what? Thats the guy that sold Q to SAP for 8...Billion?? What? And he talks and you're still kind of like, so.... a bunch of Germans were into it? But then you hear the founders statement. Then you hear his passion with customers and him addressing a real problem with emotion. This guy is genuine and he bleeds qualtrics and CARES for his business and his people. I have NEVER in my life trusted a senior executive more.","You guys really need to get a legit CPQ. This thing is awful. Run some XM for IT on your sales prod tools bc this is no good. 

Should probably consider cost of living adjustments. Reps who are in NY / Chicago / CA vs. Utah... not the same and shouldn't be paid as such 

Need more women and people of color in leadership, and senior leadership but we will get there. 

And probably the biggest gripe -- you guys HAVE to lock down license utilization between CX/EX. It is rampant and you are locking yourselves out of deals and actually losing customers by allowing them to use non-standard licenses to run these programs with no guardrails. It is wrong, and non-compliant.

Also -- healthcare kind of sucks if you actually have expensive needs. And no real way to help decide. 

But I've worked at worse companies, and I'd take these cons anyday for great leaders, growth opps, customers, and products. But still fix them please:)"
295,Qualtrics,"Great company, products, culture, and people",2020-03-04,5.0,Account Executive Level IV,"Qualtrics has a vision that will fundamentally change the way businesses interact with their customers and employees, and they have the ability to execute on that vision.  The company is growing extremely quickly, both by headcount and revenue.  This means there is some pain, but also tremendous opportunity.  I am challenged in different ways every single day, but always have the support of our ""one team"" approach to ensure I am never going at it alone.  Qualtrics drinks its own medicine and ensures its customers and employees have amazing experiences.  I would highly recommend this company to anyone that wants to be part of a fast-moving, quickly growing, scrappy, and visionary company.","As I mentioned in my pros, it is a very fast-growing company.  This means you need to adapt to things quickly, both good and bad.

The Provo office garden is nice.","There's a pervasive Yes Man culture that leads to a lot of people cutting corners rather than establishing good processes ('Scrappy' is still a company value). It worked ok as a small company but as we get larger it's more of an issue. 
High turnover and growth combined with the world's snobbiest hiring bar results in a constant flow of new people with big egos that are slow to provide value but are probably making more money than you.
Needlessly complex hiring and promotion processes.

- Big enough that I don't worry about my paycheck bouncing
- Excellent work / life balance (on my team at least)","compensation is always changing and nobody knows what to expect. the minute you think you know what to expect, something changes or an excuse is made that changes things. it's not just ics either. managers often don't know what to expect going into raises / refreshes and they're just as surprised as their direct reports. managers can tell you what the 'midpoint' is for your role / level / location, but this is hardly a 'midpoint' and more of a 'endgame pay right before you're ready to be promoted out of current level'. good luck getting accurate pay expectations from coworkers as well. it's not uncommon for somebody to get a promotion to a new level and with it get a raise / stock grant, then somebody get the exact same promotion 6 months later and end up with significantly less, then somebody else get the exact same promotion yet another 6 months later and end up with more. (btw you'd think that the middle guy would be 'caught up' to the third one, but i've seen examples that show that's not how it works either). basically, the best way to get a great comp package is to get promoted at the ""right"" time, and nobody knows when is a good time or bad time until the review cycle is already over. i feel like i live in a perpetual cycle thinking that i'm 6 months to a year away from a great raise and i never arrive; it's just dangling 6 months to a year out forever."

I don't believe in a work-life balance because if the job is important, then you should prioritize it and get it done. However, Qualtrics markets this way too heavily. There is no work-life balance. Just admit it
- This is a sales job without any of the upside of sales. The organization kids itself when it thinks that Customer Success is ""Strategic Advisors"". We hire ex-consultants and bankers only because they look good in front of a client.  The only benefit is to leadership. As a CSM, you will rarely see interesting work. It's making sure your clients won't cancel
- Pay is not competitive 
- The product is unreliable. With an organization that is heavily dominated by Sales, there's been a real gap created in Engineering. Just look at the CEO. Ryan Smith is an ego-driven Sales guy and the company reflects that."

4.) No official WFH policy
5.) Culture of Provo is not ideal for transplants. SLC/Park City are ~40 miles one way from the office. 
6.) This is not strategic advising or consulting.

I've enjoyed working and interacting with the majority of the engineers so people have been great.

Learned a lot we were constantly doing more bleeding edge stuff before being acquired after the acquisition there seemed to be more focus on integrating with SAP. Talk about going IPO again and being independent of SAP has things up in the air on priorities.","Management is still green horned and is learning. They are hiring more seasoned managers now and it looks positive at least 1 or 2 levels above team managers.

The promotion process is broken it's constantly changing and in the beginning it was more of who you socialized with or what big project you showed to higher-ups.

Many people worked 6+ years before even being considered for promotion with quite a few making large important changes that allowed the company to move faster or be more stable.

The stock was a wash, we drank the kool-aid from what was being sold yet with only a little more than 100 people have been here longer than myself it wasn't fully worth it. It would have been better to leave after 2 years to get a higher paying job than stick it out for the money.

If you really don't have other options, it might be worth taking for a year until you find someplace that'll treat you better.","Qualtrics is the only job I've had that I feel negative about.

They didn't do sick days when I worked there. There wasn't the option to work from home sick, either. I came in numerous times when I shouldn't have.

I don't know what their COVID response was, but given their general disregard for human costs vs bottom line costs, I'd be surprised if it was anything less than cynical.

High pressure, poor work/life balance. Management constantly saying this kind of dedication is par for the course in a ""scrappy startup."" I think when you're worth over a billion dollars, you lose the right to make that claim.

I've worked excessive hours in every job, but Qualtrics is the only case where I felt like I was being really exploited.

I was told that the equity compensation was a standard 4 year vest with a 1 year cliff. After I was already in the role for awhile, they finally let me know it was also contingent on a liquidity event; I could be at Qualtrics 10 years and never vest if they never sold.

This is both an extremely uncommon provision and 100% unethical to hide.

The employees who are into Qualtrics are REALLY into Qualtrics. They borrow some of the psychological techniques from MLM - and it shows in the people who don't churn out. If someone sticks around, they're either very into corporate politics or they've drank the coolaid.

Don't work here. At least find a bad company that won't pretend it's not - it's much easier on your psyche."

The company consists of 90% new grad devs. No thought in building reliable systems or designing new systems to be reliable or scalable. Feels much like devs hack away at one project and immediately jump to another without putting in care in what they are building.

404,Qualtrics,"If you are considering moving to the Provo office for engineering, DON'T",2020-05-23,1.0,Software Engineer,"- Many learning opportunities and ownership of your projects

- Catered lunches (albeit in the Provo office the foods crap anyways - not anything special and extremely high in sodium. Snacks are also sub-par; everything's in a package / not fresh, and the soda machine routinely breaks)

- Decent outings (though, truthfully our engineering ski trips is not inclusive of everyone)","Let me just first make it clear: if you are considering moving to Provo, UT to work as an engineer, absolutely DO NOT do this, especially if you're in your 20s and about to graduate university. 

1. Inaccurate performance metrics. The company values how long you've been here more than your actual contributions. The skill variance is absurd; I can think of so many L4+ engineers whom I outperform in knowledge and contributions and it's crazy how much they're getting paid to do mediocre work. So many L3s are definitely deserving promotions and conversely so many L4+s should be fired quite frankly.

2. Low skill variance in the Provo office: this comes naturally since the office recruits so heavily from BYU. Makes sense, since no one in their right mind would ever choose to voluntarily drop everything to move here. 

3. Low technical skill in general: Again, no senior developer would deliberately drop move to Utah county to babysit a bunch of crap L3s. This has led to an overabundance of junior developers who commit crap code and something's always broken all the time. Because of this, when the company does hire any senior developer into the Provo office, chances are the expectation is much lower than at other companies.

4. Disorganization / Bad PMs: At least with the team that I'm working on, if you are looking for Agile Development, do not come working at Qualtrics. Everything feels like a hackathon project (most likely because my team's been tainted by ES (engineering service, btw, don't let them sell this to you). There is no so-called ""method to the madness""; it's quite literally just madness; we don't do scrum correctly and dates and deadlines are just thrown around randomly. Many times my manager has told other teams we have a solution to a problem - when in fact, we certainly do not. 

5. Social: At the end of the day, we come into the office because it is our job; this is true. Still, I look at many of my college peers who are working at their companies and I envy how social they get to be with their coworkers who are their age and who are also new grads. If you're looking for this vibe, you will most likely not find it in the Provo office. Quite literally everyone who's a recent college grad is also already married, so they have a family to come home to after work. It can get really annoying whenever you have team lunches, and someone's ""mission"" gets brought up; I guarantee, this happens more than you probably would want it to."

Too many people for the number of accounts with the number you're supposed to hit. Upper leadership thinks more calls will equal better outcomes.

Promotions are no longer dependent on output and results but rather how you strategically jockey for position with your manager and your external perception with cross-functional teams.
2. Middle management has become bloated. There are some good managers that care — I’d even venture to say that the majority of managers truly care — but there are also others that would throw you under a bus than go to bat for you.
3. The company sells itself as having purpose solutions that were built from the ground up rather than slapping a new label on existing product (which also still occurs).

424,Qualtrics,Management Ruined Something So Promising,2019-09-29,2.0,Account Executive,"- You have the chance to work with great people
- In a space which is top of mind for nearly any executive
- My direct manager and many managers in the Dallas office truly care about AEs succeeding personally and professionally 
- Commitment to continuously improve AEs sales skills
- Ryan (CEO) has created a Go to Market machine","As a recommendation if you are interviewing in Dallas, ask how many salespeople were in the office 2 years ago and then ask how many of those people are still around today. That should tell you all you need to know. The Dallas office had a great base of people, but they ultimately were burnt out by micromanagement along with poorly aligned territories and continuous hiring of lesser talent at higher AE levels to fill growth goals. Top sales leader's ""my way or the highway"" approach is only based on past experience of how things previously were at Q before the introduction of the XM idea (many have never been at other orgs in their careers). In this pre XM era the Q salespeople focused on selling low dollar research deals where X inputs (calls, meetings, opps, etc) directly correlated to Y outputs (sales) as all deals use to be about the same size. This has not adapted over time and has led management to OVER focus on the inputs vs the outputs. In reality as Q has moved into the XM space, the way you approach strategic vs transactional deals should be very different as these deals greatly vary in size. People who hit quota typically have 1 deal that amounts to a massive amount of their quota, however if you focus on the large deals your quadrant performance goes down and you are repeatedly badgered by management to make more calls with the eventual threat of being put on a plan.

When they tell you how many people hit quota dig in deeper to understand what percentage of fully ramped AEs in Dallas hit quota. Q leadership does a great job of presenting numbers the way they want them interpreted. 

With territories already misaligned across the org and Q just announcing that they will be expanding from 2.5k employees today to 8k, I'd be nervous to see how much worse territories could be in the near future."
425,Qualtrics,Endless career growth opportunities,2016-08-27,5.0,Client Success Manager,"General: 
-Access to leadership, including the executive team, is unparalleled anywhere, particularly a company of this size and growth rate. “Transparent” value of the company really rings true here.
-Company is hitting financial goals that most companies in the Bay and Utah alike wouldn't even be able to imagine, making for an exciting exit in the future
-The growth of the newer lines of business and sectors is mirroring that of Qualtrics' initial ""rocket-ship"" expansion, with momentum only growing stronger each month.
-Great benefits/401k plan
-Huge engineering push in the past year (with opening of Seattle) will allow for quicker innovation timeline
-Work along very smart people (many Ivy League/top school grads), and everyone in Utah is incredibly kind

Client Success:
-Particularly in Client Success (but also in other divisions), managers encourage you to find areas for improvement and empower you to implement solutions, both within and beyond the scope of your team
-The ability to collaborate cross-functionally is a huge plus, as it gives you a great strategic/360 view of the company allows you to work with Sales, Engineering, Support, Marketing, etc. 
-CSMs get to have a high impact with Fortune 500 brands
-Fast personal growth due to level of responsibility, the stakes of the clients, purview of role

Overall, the careers opportunities both within your division and outside of it are there for the taking, as the promotion statistics are pretty astounding. I also relocated from a large city to work at Qualtrics, and the transition has been great.","- Engineers don’t give frequent enough updates regarding development timelines and projects
- If you’re not already raising a family, you’ll likely want to live outside of Provo. While the company provides options to accommodate, you have to commute if you want to live in Salt Lake City or Park City"

The company had I think over 2500 people and when I left there were more men named John in senior leadership than there were women in similar levels. Not because talented women don’t exist but because they have to work twice as hard to get half as far. Also, Ryan and Jared Smith are greedy and dishonest butt-heads. Where did the $500 million retention package from SAP go for employees? Straight into Ryan and Jared’s pockets when they were already billionaires. Ryan truly thinks he built this company by himself and has re-written the truth so many times at this point I don’t know what the real Qualtrics story is. But keeping stroking his ego cause if you are part of the inner bro circle, he might let you ride on his private jet. Yippee."

437,Qualtrics,Great company to bet on ... willing to bet on employees,2016-06-08,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Qualtrics is growing very quickly and that creates lots of opportunities. People who work well in ambiguous environments, who are proactive and innovative, and who take initiative do very well here. There are some who watch more from the sidelines and wonder why they don't get the same opportunities. My experience has been that if you have a good idea, can make a business case for it and are willing to do the work, then Qualtrics is willing to bet on you and give you as much opportunity as you're willing to take on. In other words, it's not just a growing company, but a company that wants you to grow with it and all the opportunities are there for the people who want them.

The culture is also really good. Qualtrics is very thoughtful about its growth and works hard to make sure it keeps what is good about the culture and is always improving in areas where things can get better (they added full payment of healthcare benefits for the employee and their families one year, they added 401K matching the next year, etc. etc.)","There are constant growing pains.

442,Qualtrics,I think Qualtrics is the best place to work in Utah,2012-01-03,5.0,,"I think Qualtrics provides the most incredible work environment around. Not only does the company pride itself on a ""Google-like"" environment but they also strive to give you as many opportunities as you can handle. One of my favorite parts of working at Qualtrics is that your opportunities and challenges are driven by you and not who you play golf with. You can become a leader in the company and take on as many challenges as quickly as you can handle them. 

I think my absolute favorite thing about the company is the people I work around. I have never worked at a company where I feel like the people I am surrounded by ALL have something to offer that is significant. I also love the fact that because everyone here is so bright and talented it pushes me to work harder and be better each day.","Qualtrics is not a 9-5 type of job and it is definitely the hardest job I have ever had in my life. If you are looking for something that will allow you a lot of time off or not be mentally challenging this isn't it. Personally, I don't find that to be a negative but I know there are a lot of people who want to come to work and be done with work. I typically work 10+ hours a day not because anyone tells me that I have to but because I feel like I have to in order to keep up with my colleagues."
443,Qualtrics,Love this company,2014-03-05,5.0,Corporate Sales,"I am not sure why there are so many employees who have had issues. I have been here for years and I absolutely love working here. I am a current employee and I feel like I am treated incredibly well. I love the fact that we have great benefits and having 100% of healthcare premiums paid for is incredible. It would take a lot for me to want to leave Qualtrics. Here is a laundry list of items I love
-pay - I feel well compensated
-benefits - mentioned above
-fantastic people - some of my best friends work here
-opportunity for growth and leadership - there is no shortage of opportunities to grow personally
-high expectations - I only want to be a part of something where everyone around me is as dialed in as I am. This isn't a ""9-5"" place.","I personally can't see many cons to Qualtrics other than the fact that it is still in startup mode and we are scrappy. We don't always have the most formalized policies and sometimes when you run fast you trip. This personally doesn't bother me but for those who are looking for a very ""corporate"" environment I think you are looking at the wrong company. The last thing is that as you get started in sales at Qualtrics you have to be in it for the long term. You will see your paychecks increase overtime but it will demand a high work load and require you to invest in yourself and the company."
444,Qualtrics,Good company but caps growth and pay,2020-02-04,4.0,Commissioned Officer,The autonomy and growth of the company are appealing due to the SAP acquisition,The AE sales org is constantly changing and it always negatively impacts individual contributors
445,Qualtrics,2+2 doesn't equal 5,2019-10-01,1.0,Account Executive,The people I work with are really incredible. There is a lot of camaraderie in the office.,"The math for success at Qualtrics does not add up.

There is a company wide initiative to increase our average deal size to $7,500 (for those of you who are interviewing... be very cautious when the recruiters tell you average deal size is $30k... you're being lied to). The ACTUAL average deal size right now is around $5,000.

You are expected to self-generate 12 opps per month as an AE and get another 4 opps per month from the SDRs (btw, you won't). 

Assuming best case scenario you get 16 opps per month (or 48 for the quarter) and a 25% close ratio, that is 12 closed opps per quarter at an average deal size of $7,500 = $90,000 in Quota Relief.

Only problem is that your quota is $140k. And the average deal size isn't actually $7,500, it's only $5,000.

This helps explain why only 10-15% of people actually hit quota in any given quarter. Recruiters will tell you 45% of people hit quota at Qualtrics, and that is true for the company as a whole. But the Dallas office is a stuck with bottom-of-the-barrel account territories (and your account book never changes).

It's a frustrating situation to be in, considering none of us took this job with aspirations of being mediocre. And the response from leadership is to call us all lazy and put incredible pressure on us to make more daily activity. 

Someone recently posted a Glassdoor review titled ""Are you willing to work for it?"" If you come to Qualtrics, you will definitely work harder than you ever have before. But at the end of the day, you won't have much to show for it."
446,Qualtrics,"Not impressed, not as advertised. Poor leadership. Buggy products make life miserable for client facing employees",2015-08-05,2.0,Manager,"Fun atmosphere. Generally nice people to work with. Great medical benefits. The company provides a lot of t-shirts. The company also stocks pantries with food, though it's mostly junk food. Impressive seasonal parties. CEO is inspirational and a natural leader.","Horrendous career paths. Not defined in any way and upward movement is rare. Lateral mobility is also difficult.
Severely lacking leadership at virtually all levels. 
Schizophrenic attention of upper management leads to terrible execution throughout. 
Culture is so-so, destructive in some cases. Lots of games, toys to project a Silicon Valley feel, but they are mostly superficial gimmicks. 
Products are unusually buggy. Much of life at Qualtrics is spent managing fires.
Upper management has little apparent vision for its teams. Occasionally, the supreme executive wand waves to divert all attention to the latest hot topic and disrupt all momentum. A huge productivity drain and short-sited. Kills morale, hurts clients. Seemingly no trust in the employees that had to pass such a ""high bar"" to get hired.
Company is intent on staying in Provo for some reason, despite the huge benefit to its employee base of moving to a more central location.
Way too many systemic problems to IPO in the near future. 
Has potential, but may have peaked. Probably not what is self-proclaimed: a unicorn."
447,Qualtrics,"Mediocre company at best, steer clear",2016-05-16,2.0,,"Massive sales machine. Open office concept. Relatively flat hierarchy, but absentee leadership. Take your dog and kids to work if you want. Most of my coworkers were pretty decent people.","Employees are disposable means to an end for this company. Every other company i've worked for treats it's employees better than Qualtrics. The main reason I left.

I've worked for a handful of tech companies, and the culture at Qualtrics is terrible. Political and definitely not merit-based. Sales is slightly different because it's easy to measure performance, but problems are widespread everywhere else.

Products are the buggiest I've sold. Company hired a lot of engineers recently, so the problem will get worse then will probably get better if they know what they're doing.

The culture probably seems so terrible because leadership tries to make such a big deal about how good the culture is, while everyone is so tired of it. 

There are three types of employees at Qualtrics: the 8-10 who will make good $ from the IPO, 90% who are demoralized but can't leave because if they do they lose all their equity, and the smart ones who are walking out the door. 

Almost everyone I knew at Qualtrics was tired and hoping to leave asap. Save yourself the trouble. Also, I agree with the guy who wrote about the fake reviews - it's simple to see which reviews are real and those that are fake."
448,Qualtrics,"The high intensity, rapid-growth, absurdly optimistic so-called ""startup"".",2017-04-14,3.0,Software Engineer,"Qualtrics is a great place to work if you're passionate about what you do, are driven, believe in Qualtrics' mission and their optimism, and want to be an engineer. They pall fairly well, have a cool building, lots of perks, and there's a lot of excitement around what's going on there. As a part-timer, it's flexible on hours.","The company is incredibly full of itself. I get being optimistic, but they seem to think they're God's gifts to tech startups and that their very presence is a favor to planet earth. I get that you're successful, but this culture is a bit extreme. 

My personal experience hasn't been the best. I'm there part-time, and frequently feel  disconnected from the rest of my team, what we're doing, etc. My onboarding process was terrible, and I didn't know very fundamental things about our engineering stack several months in. There are still big things that I feel like I don't really understand, and I have been there for a while now. Communication was virtually non-existent between myself and my team much of the time. I also am constantly switched to new contexts and don't feel that I can get a good grasp on anything before I'm moved to a different piece of the product. A lot of these pains came just because I was there part-time, but it was nonetheless not a good experience."
449,Qualtrics,Greatest place to work in the world,2018-04-07,5.0,Research Services,"I love literally everything about this place. Free lunch practically every day, snacks everywhere, soft serve ice cream, and cookies on Fridays. Scooters, comfy couches,  massage chairs, walking desks, and acres of beautiful gardens with strong WiFi to get work done in the shade of a tree. The benefits are unreal - 100% of health insurance premiums paid, 3% 401k contributions (even if you contribute $0), $2,500 a year into your HSA, 2 weeks of paternity leave, and $1,500 towards a vacation experience (on top of PTO). 

Most importantly, it’s an easy product to get behind, I’m making an impact on the world, there aren’t useless meetings, no micromanaging, I’m surrounded by smart, positive, hard-working people, and I have FUN. I look forward to going to work every day.","The only downside is that as the company grows its slowly losing the fun, fast-paced, tech start-up feel. It’s starting to feel more like a large, bureaucratic, corporation. Nothing specific and nothing that can be avoided. It has to happen as the company grows. Just kind of a bummer."
