1,Randstad Sourceright,"Not perfect, but close.",2022-01-27,4.0,Talent Sourcing Specialist,"Everyone is very friendly and understanding. When I first started a few months ago, I had several things going on from illness to a death; both times I had to take some time off for. I was nervous to tell my leadership about these things because most companies would not tolerate any absences with a new employee. My leadership said, “take care of yourself. We will be here for YOU.” When I returned to work, I received an outpouring amount of messages with offers to help support me and get me caught up with my tasks. 

Additionally, they are VERY flexible with scheduling. As long as you do what you’re supposed to, you’re fine. 

They also provide FREE office supplies, even if you work remotely. How cool is that?","I think the biggest downside of working on the project I am on is that it’s going through some growing pains. For example, because of the need for so many on our team, no one seems to know who reports to whom and it’s a bit of a mess. 

Overall though, I am confident that things will improve. I’ve had several conversations with Senior Leaders and they are transparent and open to accepting feedback to improve."

Averse to trying new things. Disorganized structure and processes. Management is disengaged, one-on-ones are cancelled more often than not. They do not encourage their people, only negative feedback and no positive is shared. People work out of fear of being fired rather than passion for their job. They're very proud of their high Glassdoor rating, but my experience with the culture didn't bear it out."

29,Randstad Sourceright,Did not like,2022-02-08,1.0,Sr Talent Advisor,No pros to working at Rsr,"Some managers have very little experience.  Pay is not competitive. To meet your numbers,  you will need to work overtime hours  including nights and weekends without pay.
A lot of manufacturing clients. Not what I like
You'll be put on the bench if they lose a client and you could be benched weeks or months without work. They tend to overhire when they get a new client and when it doesn't work out with the client, they are left with a lot of contractors out of work. 
They also rarely hire perm because it is easier to put you on the bench as a Contractor vs benching full time perm employees."

Also - *remote work* - they truly ""get it"".","Constant ethics issues. Multiple encounters of expecting hourly employees to work 50+ hours a week and only enter 40 hours on time cards.

It might be the client I am onsite working for, but every day is challenging but rewarding. I am not your typical ""lifer"" but I truly want to stay with Randstad and continue growing and moving up for as long as they let me.","Money. Moving from the desk level to on-site, you really miss that fat paycheck. At my account, we ""own"" the process between our client and candidates and it's a full service MSP. This means that its a LOT of work to keep everything moving and I don't feel we are compensated for the level of hard work and results that we produce."

Prepare for lots of meetings talking about recruiting, all the while wishing you had that time back to actually do the job. True story: one week our team was told we had the best quarter performance in the 7+ year history of working with the client, the next week we had an mandatory meeting to get our hands slapped for not following their escalation policy. In the next 30 days three highly experienced recruiters quit. Most concerning though is their employment model. It's plain unethical. If business slows down with the end-client Randtad puts you on the bench and you sit idle until you are finally forced to find another job. It's obviously a calculated strategy to keep from paying unemployment, because you're not actually released until sitting 90 days. Not many of us can wait that long to pay our bills and they rely on you quitting beforehand."

I hear almost daily management griping about how much they are paying people who live in more expensive locations.  Management also likes to pretend they're on your side at first, but don't expect them to help you at all.  Lots of fluff talk, ""it will get better"", even in cases where the employee is experiencing constant disrespect from their peers.  And if the client is treating employees poorly?

Not only am I given the resources I need to be successful in my role, I am encouraged to be creative and am recognized for jobs well done. Among the perks of my position is the occasional opportunity to travel globally which edifies me at work as well as personally.

Also, the RSR 401K program is great! They match your contribution and I've saved a good amount of money for retirement already. The job stability is good at RSR-many recruiters/sourcers are account based, and if/when an account closes, the RSR internal team does a fantastic job of finding new accounts for those employees.

The support provided by our internal talent team, the Center of Expertise, and our overall leadership provides both day-to-day support and strategic direction that sets us well above our competitiors.

For part of my tenure, I was fortunate enough to be a part of the MOST amazing team...the kind you always wish you had....but due to account changes, we were all separated after about 1.5 years.","Aside from the aforementioned manager who was exceedingly active in career development and doing whatever she could to push us towards the goals we frequently discussed, I have found it to be easy to remain stuck in the same role with little direction and guidance to grow. Although there is a good amount of noise about career development from the leadership level, I have found that more often than not, it doesnt exactly trickle down to the individual employee.

Also - it is always a hustle. High-volume is a guarantee...always, and while it is good to stay busy, it gets tedious when it is nonstop. Not to mention it restricts managers from focusing on other important areas such as career development."

If you have expertise to contribute, RSR will engage you to share, perform, and excel.

257,Randstad Sourceright,RSR Compliance Manager,2016-02-29,5.0,Compliance Manager,"I started working for Randstad Sourceright in September of 2007. Considering that RSR is a big proponent of promotion within, I have been promoted twice since starting with the company.  Each one of the associates that I work closely with can state the same thing (at a minimum). It is possible because RSR leaders recognize top talent and are willing to invest in their success. In addition, we have leadership programs in place like “Leaders in Motion” that assist in guiding you in achieving success. 

I work virtually but I have the option of coming into the office, which I take advantage of a few times a week.  I enjoy partnering face to face from time to time with my teammates and direct reports. 

Finally, the culture at RSR is one of a big team. Regardless of the client/account it’s clear that we all have the same end-result goal in mind:  To ensure the success of our clients in efficiency, timing and quality of hires while ensuring regulatory compliance with the OFCCP and/or EEOC.",The (expected) turn around time associated with work requests at times.

Excellent Internal Communication with employees, Management that continues to encourage Career growth within the company. I recently  joined the Randstad team after leaving the company three years ago.  The training program (Randstad University) is a true  added value. Company morale is heightened die to the rapid  growth in the RPO Business.","There are a couple of area's that need to be improved upon.  Tools being utilized for Recruiting are not the most effective.  For instance, Linked -IN Recruiter is not a source utilized  for external searches. The competing companies in the RPO sector have invested in upgrading to Linked-In Recruiter.    This is a tool that will give Randstad a true advantage over competing companies. One additional con for working for Randstad is the administrative work load in Recruiting. Billing should be a function of the Operations Department."
259,Randstad Sourceright,Virtual work + fantastic culture + engaged managers = AWESOME JOB,2016-01-27,5.0,Talent Advisor,"By far the best company culture I've enjoyed so far in my career... hope that I'm here for many more years to come!  My manager is focused on hiring smart, driven people - then getting out of our way and letting us be GREAT!  She's there when I need her, but never micromanages. I'm allowed a tremendous amount of autonomy, as is everyone else on my team who is productive and meets goals. Culture of progression for those who want it - access to career mapping, personal development plans & tools, and a formal mentoring program that is actually meaningful! If you like being surrounded with smart, thoughtful, and driven people who possess humility and a sense of humor- this is your home. Virtual training anytime I want it has made me a stronger recruiter. Also appreciate how many women hold positions of power at Senior manager and executive levels.","Working remote/virtual is wonderful on most days, but makes it a little tougher to build relationships. Have to really make an effort to reach out and connect with peers and managers. Leveraging more mandatory team video conference opportunities might help."

263,Randstad Sourceright,My job is fun...and I enjoy working with the folks around me,2011-11-23,5.0,Senior Recruiter,"My workpartners,  even though they are virtual, as am I, are both talented and as real to me as if we were sitting in the same office.  So far, the assimilation into the Randstad ethos has been transparent and without great stress.  Could be that since I am part of the RPO and the RPO concept is not widely known outside the US, we are a pioneer organization for Randstad.

Pay and benefits for the contractors is good and the equipment and support is solid.  I am satisfied with my role and my team.","Not really sure that there are downsides for me right now...  I have spent time on the bench, which is a pain, but is also part of the deal.  Would I like to be Associate (regular/full-time)--maybe..."

They give you training tools to help you get where you want to go, be who you want to be, in your career.","Too tempting to work more than you should, but Randstad Sourceright does promote a work/life balance, you just have to have the will power to know when to turn the computer off."

267,Randstad Sourceright,Terrible experience,2016-01-20,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Virtual and work from home opportunity.  You can also work on different accounts and gain exposure to different industries.,"The RPO model is the worst environment I've ever worked in.  It seems like every time you turn around, there are metrics being created to measure one thing or another.  It felt like the company hoped their employees don't meet their goals and looked for ways to NOT have to pay out bonuses.  For the most part, the metrics come from the SLA's between RSR and the client but the clients are often the biggest offenders, which keeps the recruiters from meeting 100% of their goals. However, RSR does not care because keeping the clients is more important than keeping good employees.  OT is common and necessary because of the heavy work load, but is never approved.  Managers don't want to hear that you need more hours to get your work done. They only tell you to manage your time better, so recruiters learn to suffer quietly and work the hours anyway. Managers have quotas too - push their recruiters to fill as many jobs in the shortest time possible, keep costs low so their numbers are good and they get to be on President's Club.  HR is useless when contacted.  They give the standard ""not reporting your hours are illegal"" and ""talk to your manager"" speeches.  If I felt comfortable speaking with my manager, I wouldn't be calling HR!!!"

Everyone helps each other out and works together as a team to achieve a common goal. Management is understanding and goes to bat for you if needed. The environment is fast-paced, yet flexible with very competitive benefits and time-off policies. There are also plenty of opportunities to grow. You'll learn a lot on the job, but you also have opportunities to use the company's online learning center to brush on anything from your communication, to your sourcing and recruiting skills.","The fast-paced environment and level of responsibilities can be both a pro and a con depending on your preferences.  Be prepared to work hard, but get rewarded for it."
