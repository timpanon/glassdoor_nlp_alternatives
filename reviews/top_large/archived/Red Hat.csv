Everybody is willing to step in and help you in any way possible to help you succeed.,"Sometimes there can be a lot of emails but it's in the vain of openness. Not a huge deal, and can filtered out pretty easily if you don't want to see them."

9,Red Hat,"Good benefits, poor middle management and job satisfaction.",2022-03-31,3.0,Revenue Accountant,"Benefits, compensation, and company-wide culture are strong.","Internal processes are often immature, ineffective, and reliant on squeezing as much out of employees until they break as possible. Rather than management investing in employee well-being and fixing processes, they only provide enough resources to keep broken processes running most of the time, all at the expense of employee job satisfaction. This has lead to poor work-life balance and a high level of turnover."

This makes for messy and ineffective plans and execution. The company is matrixed and segmented in weird ways that oftentimes seem illogical for productivity and efficiency. Change management is atrocious and there are always several business shifting changes that occur each quarter before the last load of changes had a chance to be adopted. This has resulted is mass turnover. Now there are enormous gaps in tribal knowledge, because nobody documents anything, but if they did it would be outdated. So much of the work is spinning wheels because the business won't allow to slow-down and address systemic and root cause problems. Everything is just push through and survive to the next round of changes. And forget about measuring for success, reflecting on efficacy or ROI."

Get a letter dated March 28 that my coverage ended on the March 18. Found out AFTER a trip to the ER. Never heard from HR about benefits when I gave notice.

It acknowledges this is difficult openly, and I haven't seen any changes that are truly terrifying.","The rapid growth has promoted some people into management that frankly shouldn't be there.

190,Red Hat,Amazing people,2021-07-06,5.0,Senior Technical Account Manager,I have never worked anywhere that lives up to its core values the way Red Hat does.,Not enough interaction with other people at Red Hat
191,Red Hat,Great place to work,2021-06-22,5.0,Software Architect,"Red Hat is a meritocracy. If you put in the hours, do good work, always work to improve your skillset and advocate for yourself, you will find success. I hired in as a Consultant with no tech degree (self taught Java). Through hard work and advocating for myself, I made it to Consulting Architect in 6 years. Others have done it much faster.

Even though the company has become more corporate as it has grown, there is still a Wild West sense to some of the divisions (I've worked in 3 different divisions over 10 years). With that chaos lies opportunity, but also unease if you desire more structure. Be cognizant of this when hiring into a division. If the division culture is too staid or not startup-y enough, transfers are usually allowed.

I very much enjoy working with other people at Red Hat. Even though we come from a relatively diverse set of backgrounds (by tech's standards), we all have common ground in the work we do and the culture of the company.

If you are passionate about something tangentially related to your work, you are encouraged to pursue that. Whether that be building a rack, writing bootstrapping code or working on open source projects, Red Hat rewards go-getters.","The acquisition by IBM hangs over the company. There is a sense that if RH slips in growth or profits once, the IBM overlords will assimilate our culture to be more like IBM to 'fix' us. While this may not be true, that potentiality is openly discussed.

Some of the software suites RH develops have lofty physical requirements. Many employees that have to deal wth that software in a daily capacity have had to resort to building their own home labs in order to run the software to learn and resolve client issues."
192,Red Hat,"Good people, good culture",2021-07-09,4.0,Leadership Development Program Manager,"Good people, good culture. Flexible work environment (since COVID).",Pay is lower than other companies in the area.
193,Red Hat,Sexism- Culture was the reason I joined RH and the main reason why I left.,2021-07-22,1.0,Senior Level Employee,"I truly loved working with so many people throughout RH and I learned a lot from so many of my peers. I’m forever grateful for the connections I made here and the people who supported me during my time with the company. I also had fantastic management (this is very team dependent) during my time at RH. The benefits here are decent. Pay is ok, but not nearly competitive to other companies. Remote work is supported and seamless. The addition of recharge days this last year was great! PTO is generous.","I can easily spot fake reviews plastered here. I’ve also been tracking the reviews lately and as of last month when you filtered reviews by demographics it was very clear how women and marginalized groups felt internally. This gap magically closed overnight? My strong recommendation for job seekers is to sort reviews by the lowest ratings and pay attention to the common trends/dates when making your decision. Also, ask LOTS of really direct questions in your interviews!!

The culture that was pitched to me in interviews and promoted ad nauseam internally was not at all what I saw or experienced. RH is by far the most toxic work environment I’ve ever been in! Sexism, racism, and nepotism are not only rampant, but blatantly overt. RH prides itself on being diverse and inclusive (it says so on the website!), but internally that couldn’t be further from the truth. This is still very much a white-male dominated environment with a strong bro culture. All of the affinity groups RH is so proud of just serve as therapy gatherings for marginalized employees. There is zero transparency into promotions and pay, as a result meritocracy is pretty much a joke here. Gender pay gaps are real. If you work in departments outside of engineering, your opinions won’t matter. Engineering rules all at RH and they’ve been allowed to essentially dictate how the other departments run. As a result it is pure chaos and departments have zero autonomy to make decisions and changes to benefit their employees. This overarching engineering control consistently fuels fighting between departments/BUs over seemingly everything. It also fuels departmental silos...and even more so along product lines. I had to force/beg for cross-departmental collaboration and spent so much time forcing people to work together and think outside their bubble. I never succeeded with engineering. They were content doing it their way and their way meant all the supporting teams were kept in the dark and then bashed repeatedly for not “keeping up” with them. If you like structure and process, RH is NOT the place for you. It’s not merely about keeping up in a fast-paced environment and being agile….you’ll need to survive in pure turmoil. Company direction changes all the time. There are no clear roadmaps for some of the products. No solid go-to-market strategies. Engineering will deliver functionality without including QE/Docs, because those departments are always drowning and behind. Support teams are understaffed and flailing. We STILL let customers toss money at us and shift to focus on that vs building stability into our products. Tooling in departments supporting engineering is mediocre at best. You’ll sit in hundreds of meetings to discuss something and then zero action will come of it. The internal dysfunction makes it incredibly difficult, if not impossible, to just do your job.

Outside the general internal dysfunction, the bulk of my poor negative experience at RH was directly the result of sexism from male colleagues. A lot of the constant issues I faced boiled down to a toxic culture and management chains that don’t know how to advocate for their teams properly. As much as we promote ""teamwork"", RH leadership is more focused on keeping/owning control of their functional areas vs being a part of the larger team. A lot of self-serving exists in leadership. If I'm honest, my biggest regret was not leaving this company sooner. I should’ve left after the first time I brought up toxic/sexist behavior and watched it get swept under the rug. And months later when I watched male peers from across the company support the gender pay gap and marginalize women OPENLY on a company-wide mailing list, it should've been my cue to go. I saw all I needed to see here."

- Working with open source technologies day-to-day
- Friendly and supportive coworkers","- Test code is closed source; your contributions may not be open as a QE

- Emphasis on fulfilling internal QE objectives (reporting, internal tooling, etc) sometimes overrides working on testing customer deliverables
- International organization - be prepared for lots of meetings, especially in the mornings and occasionally late evenings
- Somewhat adversarial relationship between QE and development orgs at times. Each has their own areas of focus and they don't always align

- Diversity and Inclusion is more talk than action and HR or People Team are more ombudsmen or a buffer between employee and management than true HR 
- Change for change sake often leads to duplicative and redundant roles 
- Very little mandate to affect or enfirce said change thus your exposure & therefore influence beyond your small sphere of contacts is limited by a very oddly matrixed yet heirarchical org/reporting chart/chain.

267,Red Hat,as a long-time Software Quality Engineer,2021-04-01,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Red Hat work environment is very open and encouraging. Software Quality Engineer (QE) in Red Hat usually takes responsibilities way beyond just testing software. Depending on the experiences and projects, QE will also need to develop test plan/cases/automation and communicate with counterparts in Dev/PM/Support etc, thus we have opportunities to grow in many aspects.
Also QE can contribute to whichever project they'd like, and due to Red Hat is fully open-source, there is hardly any limit on where to share your codes or technical blogs.",Red Hat has huge and comprehensive portfolio.

Health Insurance Benefits

Travel, as long as there isn't a pandemic","Management focuses solely on sales targets, and absolutely ignores root cause for keeping up with market trends in practice/tech, which is farming the same talent out without investing in their new hires to take over.

You'll commonly be at 100-120% billable allocation if you have a skillset and know what you're doing, while newbies sit on the bench indefinitely not getting experience. Management struggles to train and enable their employees, and doesn't hold people accountable. Favoritism forms an endless cycle of fighting for the same few people to staff projects.

Everything is wild west. There are no processes, everything is off the hip. All the best and brightest that form standard collateral just get railroaded by sales until they can't produce anymore.

Red Hat touts being an open organization, but have incompetent senior staff that play politics/favorites if you don't do exactly what they say. The entire environment is high-context that relies on information hoarder/busy bodies that don't actually do technical work. Your input isn't valued.

People with loftier titles haven't done technical work in decades.

They constantly compare you to others who work overtime and say you’re not getting enough done. Deadlines and appearing to be on schedule are more important than any of the values they claim to have. They lie about giving you 20% time devoted to your own projects. They lie about letting you use whichever tool you’re most comfortable with. They constantly micromanage and bully you by assigning ‘mentors’ AKA ‘spies’ that are informing your manager of any flaws you may have and telling you that you suck and don’t get enough done. They give you a 90 day goals and expectations and even though you meet and exceed everything on that paper, if they don’t like you as a person none of that matters and they invent new goals at the end and pretend that you were supposed to have met that invisible goal. They lie about you and make up untrue assumptions about you, and then spread those lies to others and to HR to get you fired. It’s a very toxic environment."

All of that is true and deeply engrained in the stratregic opertions of the company. At a more personal level, Red Hat is big tech, so the benefits and work perks are outstanding. PTO is very generous, health plans are top notch, and comp is high.","The open source becomes somewhat muddled at the tactical level, especially in Red Hat Consulting. Many recent leadership hires have come from Big Consulting and operational direction of RHC to to become more like Big Consulting. There is increasing emphasis on micro-management, and less focus on the amazing technology leadership that our consulting team provide. Inernal promotions have slowed, and as more and more eladers come from outside the Red Hat culture, the culture is increasingly eroding. Opportunites for advancement are also declining as those same new leaders seek to bring in their friends, no integrate into the legacy culture."

Red Hat has built an amazing culture of openness and innovation.","The Customer Success/Support organization is moving more towards top down structure-based organization(innovation is being stifled)
Difficult to get promoted in a managerial role given the saturation of managers in the hierarchy.
New ideas and innovation is being stifled by bringing outside big tech managers in who bring their non-open cultures as well."

328,Red Hat,Be yourself,2021-01-21,5.0,Principal Business Systems Analyst,"I have never worked anywhere where I feel as much like myself as I do here at Red Hat. The culture is what it says it is. There is no lip service and where there is a lack of transparency or any hint of insincerity, it gets called out. Leadership expects it. People say what they mean and are free to disagree. I feel valued for my opinion, even when it turns out to not be the best way.

People are encouraged to find their own path. I have only been here for a little over a year but have already seen a new job be created for someone because that was the direction she was naturally interested in and there was a need. I myself was promoted after only 7 months. Red Hat truly cares about their people.

Also, people here are really smart! I don't recall ever working anywhere with so many intelligent and reasonable people. It's truly a joy to be around so many people who are good at what they do.","Let's be honest - all this openness does not result in fast decisions. Fast decisions are made where needed (read: COVID) but in an open organization, where multiple viewpoints are solicited, it naturally takes longer. It can be frustrating. Ultimately it results in a better decision but takes some getting used to."

Red Hat offers the chance to solve problems in the ways that seem best to our team, and has a huge well of talent and experience to draw on for advice. Red Hat also doesn't (officially) demand that you spend a lot of time doing off-hours work, though the needs of communication in globally distributed teams often makes this much more ambiguous.","Infrastructure and team efficiency support is not always the best. You can pursue the solutions you think best, but the downside is that you might have to support it yourself. Our organization has been a bit reluctant to adopt some more modern practices, such as SRE and service observability. You are in charge of your own education and training, in order to implement solutions to your problems. Although Red Hat does offer a wide array of training courses, finding time to take them can be quite challenging. Finally, global distribution of engineering teams has taken a large toll with some teams, in terms of finding a sustainable work-life balance (you simply cannot factor out timezones)."

396,Red Hat,"Talks a big game, does not deliver",2020-11-27,1.0,Manager,"Until the IBM acquisition, the employee return on stock RSUs was pretty good.","Senior career opportunities at Red Hat are hidden well out of view. If you are an engineer or other individual, you can make it to principal through hard work and results. If you are a manager, the only career options open to you are entirely based on who you know and depend your narrow personal group — other units are insular and out of reach. 

The CEO talks a big game of ideals and Open Source openness. Quite simply interviewing folks for promotions, or even just posting the opening for internal applicants (instead of secretly deciding who of your friends gets promoted) are old practices that companies a lot less full of themselves have followed for decades. In Red Hat, senior openings  are an exercise in closed door decisions for the existing old boys club. 

Let's not get even started on diversity. This is the most white, male company I have worked at, and this is not a particularly diverse industry so the baseline would be so easy to beat."

Even after these occasions, it apparently wasn't possible for me to get involved in the kind of work that had been described during my interviews/onboarding, nor was anyone aboveboard about this. Additionally, my pay lagged woefully behind the industry, so I left the company making less (because of inflation) than I did when I joined."

Red Hat's CEO is candid and direct while maintaining focus on Red Hat's future success. Red Hat is the best company I have worked for.",There are pockets of the company that do not share the overall cultural goals. Some areas have leadership misalignment and feint the meritocracy mindset.
401,Red Hat,toxic,2020-11-04,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Pandemic approach that puts employees first and isn't forcing us to return to the office before we're comfortable. Very generous paid time off policy.,"On paper, Red Hat’s famous “open culture” seems fantastic, and there are plenty of Kool-Aid drinkers who praise it and leadership ad nauseum. But what companies like Red Hat fail to recognize is that an “open” culture tends to become unsupportive and downright toxic when the company consists primarily of people belonging to the privileged class.
Case in point: Certain Red Hatters have been doing the right thing by trying to replace longstanding tech terms that perpetuate a hostile environment for traditionally oppressed populations. The result is a bitter feud on the company-wide mailing list, with too much repetition of the same tired arguments citing dictionary definitions and the “offense” of totalitarian-like language control. The problem, of course, is that the people making these arguments refuse to understand that tradition and dictionaries were created by the class that did the oppressing and that it’s time to give voice to the oppressed. Watching this conversation devolve has been incredibly demoralizing.
Then there’s the fundamental concept of the open decision framework, which calls for transparency and inclusivity in decision making. In practice, at least in my department, key decisions are still made in an isolated, top-down manner by one or two department leaders, often not even eliciting feedback from other department leaders, resulting in confusion, toxic fallout from the associates negatively impacted by the decision, and often multiple efforts going on at cross purposes because one group doesn’t know what another is doing. 
Overall, I do not recommend Red Hat as a place to work, and I am seeking to get out as soon as I can."

Some of these people in mgt have no clue what it takes to properly support a specific type of team and won't recognize where help is needed.
My first place where mgt is extremely incompetent in some depts. Some super smart people yet also have some of the dumbest people in charge with literally no past experience managing what they are managing. They didn't even work their way up so literally are clueless.

Being at this company for 5+ years with different roles I have had experience with an array of management types. For the most part, the transparent value that Red Hat strives and asks for helps when having open conversations with a leadership team, however, you will always come across a personality clash or a manager who's only goal is to acquire as much territory as possible in order to continue to get promoted/recognized whether it makes logical sense or not. Where career growth can be difficult at Red Hat is if you have been here for several years, potentially in different departments, you can find yourself having to take lateral moves just to ""develop your career"" this really hinders your ability to continue to grow your salary range due to the company policy of only a certain max percentage can be given for promotion at any given time. Depending on the department, there is not a standard salary base for the same role you'll find in others.

Red Hat products underpin a large sloth of other enterprise technologies.","If I could nag for one thing it would be access to stock options earlier in the Red Hat career path. Aside from this, if you are a software developer, the usual pitfalls will still apply, i.e., work life can be hard to manage at times especially for remote workers, there is a political aspect to your work (what gets adopted, what doesn't and why) that you have to adapt to, and there are physical strains from stationary working over long periods.

435,Red Hat,Easily the Best Company Ever,2020-06-22,5.0,Acquisition Account Representative,"Honestly? There are too many to list here. 

Red Hat is a one-of-a-kind organization. Period. And it's an honor to be a part of their tremendous growth.

Perks/Compensation: On a basic employee level, the compensation is significantly higher than any other organization around. The benefits are everything you could hope for, and they are constantly asking us, the associates, for feedback and other ways to improve. 

Culture: The OpenSource culture they foster here is amazing and fosters a sense of camaraderie, transparency, and togetherness. This is reflected even within the sales organization, where the sales team mentality is ""win-as-one"" without the typical corporate cutthroat, hierarchical/competitive sales culture. And if you ever need help, there's no end of colleagues willing to assist you. 

Work/Life balance: Everyone is working from home right now for the foreseeable future, but most Account Executives before the pandemic were remote and frequently traveling for customer meetings. Although at the higher levels of the sales structure you'll see a lot of traveling, Red Hat has always been committed to telling us ""family/personal life first, work second"". You can see that evidenced in their recent ""recharge days"", where they have given almost ever associate a random day off, just to help with mental health and general wellness during these trying times. 

Goals/Mission: We have high goals and standards, but we are given all of the tools to meet them. And there's a TON of upward/cross mobility here--if you are looking for a career and a place to grow as a professional, this is where you belong. Upper management has the mission to increase our size by x3 within the next few years, so I'm betting there's going to be a ton of changes but a plan of action that will absolutely get us there. 

Senior Leadership: Red Hat's senior leadership is virtually flawless. Their response to COVID has been one of the most humane and comforting out of any organization I've heard to date. They are transparent as possible and I truly trust their direction and decisionmaking. 

TLDR; As things stand, I will be a lifelong Red Hat employee because of the ways I have been treated in this organization.","It can be stressful at times with high goals and high quotas, especially during a recession/pandemic, but the way the company has handled these changes and offered enormous help will make me a lifelong employee and advocate.

Management can be stressed at times and sometimes they can reflect that stress in team meetings, but in my experience, they are quick and willing to engage in a useful dialog to remedy the situation. My manager has even apologized for cursing at me at one point and has been proactive to change that method of dialog."

Communication failures between all levels of management are so consistent that meetings discussing anything in the company feel schizophrenic.
Sexual harassment from male and female managers is so prevalent and intentionally unaddressed it is alarming.
Terminally un-inclusive.  If you are a woman or person of color, get ready to be marginalized and overlooked.
High levels of attrition.
Zero time is provided for training and professional development.
HR will side with management 100% of the time and tell employees point blank that only a managers word matters.
Unless you happen to be on one of the two or three teams with managers who can walk and chew gum simultaneously, do not expect meaningful performance reviews.
Management openly mocks employees when they think no one is listening.
Employees are harshly critiqued if they point out problems or issues but do not also supply the immediate fix to management.  
Management habitually lies about their concerns for everyone’s work-life balance.
Many managers and associate managers are in meetings from the moment they walk in the door until the end of day, preventing any management from actually occurring.
It’s a “do your job and your managers job and some of your colleagues jobs too for good measure” sort of place to work.
Untruthful management.
Inconsistent management.
Costly misguided pet projects that waste employees time and ultimately produce no viable product are the norm.
What was important last week will like not be important next week and employees will be punished for not anticipating the changes.

Frequent management advances mean employees get to have a revolving door of mostly inexperienced and unqualified associate managers throughout their career.
Merit is not appreciated or recommend.

Hyper-cliquey.
People with inconvenient health conditions will be fired.
Performance is actually irrelevant, but how an employee is perceived is paramount.
All of an employees knowledge and good will absolutely will be abused by most managers.

466,Red Hat,How much you'll like it depends on what you're looking for,2019-11-21,3.0,Quality Engineer,"If you like working remote 100% of the time, this is a great fit; most of the quality engineering team is distributed around the world and remote teaming is required.

Solid benefits offerings and compensation.

Most folks are engaged and highly opinionated about technology, sometimes ad-nauseum. This level of passion is a good thing for a company that is focused on technology and collaboration.

The variety of technologies and learning opportunities available mean that you'll have plenty of chances to brush up on the latest Red Hat sponsored open-source technologies. If you like to learn and grow, this is a good place to be.","The remote work aspect is an impediment to collaboration between development and quality engineering; expect things to move much more slowly than an environment with co-located team members. Sometimes quality engineering work can feel like a ""rubber stamping"" charade at this company.

Heavy emphasis on correspondence via e-mail. Conversations and decisions that would be made more effectively via a real-time discussion are often taken care of via e-mail or online chat. 

There is an emphasis on being receptive to feedback, but this openness doesn't always extend to taking action, even if the benefits are obvious. Sometimes feedback is simply passively ignored. Some things can be changed. Some can't because of inertia.

For an open source company, the source code for test automation is strangely kept private. This is reflective of the internal structure of the company - quality engineering is not formally included in the engineering part of the organization."

When I spoke to the People Team about my concerns they told me about the work they have put into have an ""OPEN CULTURE and OPEN Management"" BUT IT DOESN'T apply to the 13th floor AKA the SALES DEPT. HR admitted this themselves and told me that they are constantly getting complaints about the sales culture. The Sales organization is BACKWARDS. It is mostly run by 20-30 something men with HUGE ego's who believe in the Wolf of Wall Street sales environment where you work until 8PM or even some nights until Midnight. There is little to no concern for people with families. You feel guilty for taking PTO or asking to work remote even though we all have laptops and VPN access. We are all micromanaged through different tools integrated with Salesforce and other apps. There are even monitors under your desk to see how often you are at your desk. I wish someone would had told me that the ""open culture"" did not apply to the Sales Department. I would be curious to know what their turnover rate.

For better or for worse, the culture is very open - no one is afraid to speak their mind, and the CEO actually responds to communication from individual contributors.  

Compensation and benefits are very fair, IMO - certainly not the best in the industry, but I have no complaints.","Linux subscription growth is slowing, and customers aren't as afraid to go it alone without vendor support, after seening the Amazon, Googles, and Facebooks of the world do everything in house.  Ansible and OpenShift are the big drivers at this point, and if you're not tied to one of those products, you'll feel like you're not that important.

The openess I mentioned as a pro can be a bit of a negative at times - sometimes you get streams of consciousness from product management  about road map items without fully thought out messaging, which will scare the sales staff away from a particular produt.  

There can be a cult-like mentality at times - some associates believe Red Hat can do no wrong because open source is inherentlly good, and proprietary software is therefore evil."

They seem to think that they have come up with the incredible technology that they have literally stolen from baby geeks  to awe struck to realize they are being taken advantage of.  Shame on you Red Hat.  

Why are all these market analysts predicting IBM will take a hit?  What reality are they in?  THINK.  This is the best thing that has ever happened to Red Hat.  Of course, most of the employees will be laid off and replaced by offshore workers or ""new collar"" workers.  Configuration is simply not as difficult as the more ""SR"" team members like to make it out (that's just their egos).  Welcome to the Borg folks.  You are much more replaceable than you and your foolish friends believe.  

I find the majority of the reviews here comical and if you do your homework you'll find some articles out there about Red Hat's demand for loyalty.  Thus all the kissing up.  You can cool your jets.  IBM has actual ethics and tracks your value add vs lip service.  
 
The word Meritocracy was thrown around a lot at Red Hat but this only equates to Mediocrity after all the nepotism.   I've never encountered such a lack of original thinking and innovation (not to mention integrity).  Why the attitude and pretension?    These people are truly entertaining with their ""humility"".

Remote work benefits could be slightly better -- no gym or office supplies allowance, etc. The Red Hat offices are awesome, so going remote means you miss out on some cool stuff every now and then, especially t-shirts.

Salary is very good, but obviously not competitive with FANG stock grants. No stock options as far as I'm aware. I've heard you don't get yearly raises."

564,Red Hat,I wish I had been told!,2018-09-11,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"If you come from a small company, Red Hat offers things like Employee Stock Purchase Programs, 401K matching and a variety of healthcare options. Your work life balance is exceptional and really good if you have kids and want to work a basic 9-5 job. You'll get 15 PTO days and the week between Christmas and New Years off without having to use PTO.  Majority of the people are very nice and genuine.","Red Hat calls themselves a startup but are far removed from the scene with 25 years of Dot-com experience. You'll often be tasked with using programs that are long deemed as archaic. My department alone used 30+ programs to be what they considered ""functional."" Some of these programs were last updated in the 90's and were not considered to be obsolete. You have no say in trying to offer opinions on how to improve processes but will be put in groups where you waste your time weekly on coming up with ideas of how to improve processes without the ability to make a real difference. 

The majority of employees at Red hat have never worked another job and are unaware the opportunities out there for them elsewhere. This encourages group think and a lack of innovation since few people have an outside perspective. As a manager, if I had someone apply to work with me and I see they previously worked at Red Hat for more than a year, I would not even consider looking at them knowing how little them likely grew while working there. 

Business outlook is always questionable. Ask anyone who works there what direction they see Red Hat heading, most will have no idea. The majority of the company runs on the belief everything is going fine(who knows why) so it should continue that way. If you're looking for a company who tasks risks that create payoffs, this is not the company for you. 

If you've been acquired by Red Hat, start job searching asap."

Lack of innovation: if you are looking for somewhere with innovation and do research, RH is not it. 2 thirds of the company is sales and marketing. Very few people are actually on the product side.

Mansplaining appears to be the de facto practice at this company.

Rapidly growing company without structured objectives also means lots of teams are fighting for overlapping responsibilities, driving distrust between would-be colleagues and wasted efforts all around. Newer leadership does not work well with more tenured leadership, trickling down to poor relationships between individual contributors on different teams and dramatically differing expectations.

635,Red Hat,The world's foremost open source company,2017-11-11,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Red Hat is an enterprise software vendor unique for its commitment to open source software, employing many experts across foundational technologies. It's incredibly common to meet engineers who are brilliant yet humble, ""I work on (the Linux kernel/GNOME/glibc), no big deal"" that it's easy to forget that most companies don't have this level of talent. This is frequently because the best engineers are so dedicated to open source that they wouldn't consider working for anyone less committed than Red Hat.

Engineers are given wide latitude to work with the community and write high-quality code, even if it takes a long time. Depending on your role and responsibilities, working hours are flexible and remote work is common, which is an ideal situation if you have young children. Associates are encouraged to provide feedback on company-wide mailing lists and the subscription business model leads to predictable revenues and therefore consistent profit-sharing bonuses.","If you're not in one of the major offices like Raleigh, you can expect to be sidelined to some extent, unless you're in a role that includes travel to HQ regularly. I don't think this is intentional; just the usual ""out of sight, out of mind"" situation.

In many ways, working at Red Hat is like being at a non-profit: strong mission (devotion to open source), less stress than other companies, diverse workforce, but lower compensation than industry peers. The projects that Red Hat initiates are usually poorly-managed and chronically underfunded, so they are usually quietly discontinued after some time. Red Hat works best when contributing to projects that other companies are leading, such as Kubernetes and Docker, but that limits growth opportunities and reduces the value proposition of its products.

Despite the talk of transparency and openness, many leaders simply don't want to hear dissenting opinions (hey, it's human nature), so encouraging open dialog often results in employees unknowingly stunting their own career development by speaking out."

Most of these pockets exist in the areas that deal directly with customers.","- Back Office management and leadership are not able to get out of their own way to allow people to develop processes and policies to support the growth that the company is experiencing. Stale leadership causes there to be missed opportunities and does not allow for trust in the associates to innovate and help grow the company to its fullest potential.
- Lack of accountability within leadership trickles down and impacts the team and projects. There is an aversion to setting clear success measures for internal projects which leads to failures on many levels that are not acknowledged, addressed or corrected.
- The high performers are overburdened and the underperforming favorites are given the opportunities to take on large stretch assignments. When they inevitably do not deliver, the work/responsibilities are passed on to the high performers to clean up or take the blame OR the project is abandoned all together without acknowledgement or lessons learned from the failure.
- Work life balance is poor for high performers. Low performers are rarely coached nor are deficiencies addressed . They are allowed to stay and some times are promoted which is the opposite of meritocracy.
- Management will hire subject matter experts but will not listen to them if it does not align with their personal agendas.
- Politics runs rampant and is difficult to navigate. This is due to the lack of accountability and tendency to give in to big egos or insecurities."

This also gives you lots of room to innovate and to the environment."
704,Red Hat,Went from great to average in 8+ years,2017-02-07,3.0,Principal Software Engineer,"- A pro that doesn't have a caveat is hard to come up with. 
- Remote friendly for the most part, but don't expect travel dollars.
- Newly created ESPP (better late than never and the result of equity grants being eviscerated)
- Benefits relatively standard. Nothing sticks out. 
- Opensource,  although you can work in opensource in many companies
- Lots of training available. If you are at a site, you can get all the training/certifications you want for free as long as the classroom has space. But there are no travel dollars for this. If you are remote, this is somewhat of a con. There is a fairly large amount of online training, but nothing that will lead to a cert.
- Smart tech people, but there are smart people everywhere. 
- The shutdown days have been made into company holidays, so you don't have to burn PTO and essentially get 4 more days off. The con on this is that if you carry over PTO into the following year, you must use it by Feb 15th. If you don't use it, you lose it. Yeah, this is actually a con for many people.
- Easy to get promoted up to senior level. Promotions are a dime a dozen at the lower levels. Everybody gets promoted.  I've seen some people get promoted who really shouldn't be. Principal level is harder, but the domain you work in can make the principal promotion easier. For example you would have to almost be Torvald's deputy to get a principal promotion in kernel space.  See cons.","- Equity grants practically non-existent now. No longer have a new hire grant. Retention grants may hit 1 out of 10 employees now and they are so small as to be about $2000 in stock per year. Likely the driver for the new ESPP program.
- Many management new hires from large behemoth companies. They don't fit here and have created a management versus worker mentality rather than the previous one team mentality. It's ironic because they bring the stuff that didn't work from their old jobs and make Red Hat like the company they left. The ""old-timers"" who have been promoted to management still walk the talk, but are pressured by these new people and all the junk/process they bring with them.
- Strange PTO policy. After 5 years you get 3 more days, 10 years another 3 more. 
- There is favoritism. Buddies get the promotions, the money, and the opportunities.
- Low pay. No formal salary merit increase policy. Your salary used to be reviewed every June, but no more. Seems to be just whenever your manager feels like it. So if you have a cost cutting penny pincher new hire manager from one of those large companies, chances are you won't see an increase and are underpaid. I've heard it may be an 18 mo cycle now, but haven't seen evidence that it's in operation. Besides why 18 months versus a standard 12 month year?
-  There is talk that the bonus could go the way of the equity grants.  Sounds like something Frank would want and since he is gone now,  this may not materialize.
- No promotion path after principal. Very few senior principals+ in engineering and non-existent in the support side of the house. The unfortunate result is there is no career path after principal. I've seen quite a few top level people (committers and the like) leave and this along with the other cons is why (particularly the culture change from the new managers).
- Used to get the tools to do our jobs. No longer do development/tech employees get workstations. You used to get a laptop and a workstation, but no longer. You get a laptop. The result is people self fund their hardware. Likely the change was some great idea from one of the new managers."
705,Red Hat,Reality v. The Executive Pitch,2017-02-24,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Great technology and a lot of very smart people.  Flexible and most teams are very open to working remote.,"Reality does not line up with what executives will pitch.  For example, using the Open Decision Framework - reality, not used often or as often as it should or by all teams.   Executives will use the ""ask for forgiveness rather than permission or input"" approach instead of the ODF for decisions that may be unpopular.  The concept of the Red Hat culture and openness seems to vary by team, managers in some groups struggle to communicate with their peers in other groups.  The company wastes a ton of money on duplicate tools for the sake of appeasement."

Blame game. There is no accountability, especially with senior leaders, so they blame and point fingers at others.

No trust or collaboration. Leaders don't trust one another, so they expect us to work around teams, even when it's detrimental to the company. Set up a competing and redundant team. Spend money on outside help. Don't share information when asked.

Some technical staff are given huge latitude to pursue their own paths within open source communities.

The bureaucracy is present, as at any large US company, but rarely gets worse than a bit of benevolent clumsiness.","The company is deeply divided and siloed between the traditional RHEL product and the myriad other product lines brought in via acquisitions.  There are continual management initiatives to try and build bridges but they're usually of the ""pointy haired"" variety and go nowhere.  Every 6 months there's a new ""common framework for X"" project, and another such project quietly dies.

There is a culture of cheapness, from placing offices in lesser-known towns, to constantly delaying salary cycles, to even asking some staff to share hotel rooms.

Groups that are supposed to span the silos, like docs and testing (which red hat insists on calling ""QE"") are weak -- the docs guys are good but too few in number, the testing guys are mostly junior hires who are given more work than they can reasonably be expected to handle.

Basically, it's a place you can carve out a very comfortable and interesting niche if you want, but to do so you have to be able to tune out the sound of all the chaos and waste around you."

Great folk in brand realising that marketing sucks hugely and doing their best to fix it
Business unit core staff building on love and devotion given they have no leadership
Core Open Source stuff not what it was in 2001 but this is 2017 so it's acceptable its' lost focus
Good people in the HR and People Teams doing their best with limited resources","Extremely naive management, infighting and constantly re-assessing because they have no clue what customers want or need or how customers are now able to support a lot of their platform and hybrid needs themselves.
Poor leadership in the field around customer and sales engagement understanding Red Hat's place in the bigger ecosystem.
Turning into Oracle fast with no hand on the tiller to actually steer the ship
Pay is poor. The disparities in pay between roles is enormous and progression is almost impossible."
717,Red Hat,Senior Solution Architect,2017-02-12,5.0,Senior Solution Architect,"Coming from closed source software companies and very large matrixes organizations, I have been thoroughly happy at Red Hat for almost 3 years now. 

Red Hat, an open source software company, brings the open source philosophy into the organization across all teams and levels. Open dialogue is COMPLETELY supported,  encouraged and almost never penalized.

Your ideas are always welcomed with rewards based on Meritocracy. This is very refreshing as a middle line employee.",Compensation tends to be about 10-20% lower than comparable positions within comparable types or companies.

Red Hat right now still enjoys a good reputation in the OS space but as this is now dropping hugely in the world of containers and Cloud where the OS layer is nowhere near as important it's going to be a fight and it's both technology and fiduciary and I worry for their relevance positioning. 
Good offices, good remote worker support and good HR team who were utterly caned by the idiot former CFO who thought he could repeat Cisco and make this a fit company.","Thankfully the utterly incompetent CFO is now gone but a HUGE amount of poor middle management and regional directors remain. The board need to start culling people. Now, not in 18 months and only taking a look at themselves and seeing where strategic management has failed will breed new innovative repeatable success. Broken processes (Compass ha... yes thats an utter joke) and other platforms fail to deliver to an overpaid Head of HR globally. The whole company lacks the color to change and fails to deliver its expectations because the board don't know what customers actually need. Summit proves this every year."

Despite its large size, the old Red Hat was a family that cared about its employees.","The Frank Caleroni era will go down as the most destructive period in the company's history. Over a mere 18 months, many of the company's brightest leaders were driven out of the organization and replaced by big company groupthinkers who tried to apply a huge company bureaucracy to a thriving, unique mid-sized company in growth phase. In addition, this leadership has actively eliminated US jobs and shipped the work to India. Predictably Red Hat is now facing operational problems that other large companies experienced 10 years ago with this strategy.

Red Hat employs THE though leaders in Open Source and you won't find a group of more talented people anywhere else. If you want to work with the best this is where they are.

Also, ethics are a priority from top down. Every company meeting I've attended where some other company did something questionable in the last quarter it was a priority of top management in the meeting to drive home the point that similar mistakes will not be tolerated and ethics must be foremost in all actions.","Benefits. They are clearly structured to be just good enough to keep people from leaving. This is surprising considering Red Hat's primary (only?) asset is the intelligence, skill and ability of the employees. To my mind benefits should be a priority for the company but come out to be barely average. This sadly seems to be by design because they understand the main motivation for new employees is to work with the most talented individuals in the industry.

Competitive Dental & Medical Benefits 
Fair 401k matching 
Most facilities are nice 
Many friendly co-workers
Good brand equity in market","Red Hat has changed quite a bit since I initially started. While some of the changes are positive, many are not. I work in sales in a remote location in the US. The environment in my current office is similar to a 3 ring circus. Employees are being paid to surf the internet most of the day. It's common to see folks watching movies or TV shows full screen during the work day. There is no HR or oversight in this office, so management in Raleigh turns a blind eye to the productivity with a ""out of sight, out of mind"" mindset. This can be demoralizing for employees who want to come in and do a good job, because there are no tangible consequences for bad behavior, which is essentially the same as condoning said behavior. 

On a macro level, I've noticed there seem to be some subtle but visible negative changes in terms of budgeting that have trickled down. For example, many US teams workloads or the team itself are being moved to Pune. This change had diminished quality and accessibility of work formerly done by teams in Raleigh due to time zone differences, etc. I've also noticed more roles being outsources to CGS and SSI as a cost saving effort versus keeping those roles in-house with Red Hat. 

Management and Execs present the facade of open communication and transparency with employees, because they want to preserve their exorbitant paychecks. Meanwhile, the standard company merit cycle appears to have been abolished or suspended? The cycle is supposed to be every 12-18 months. Salaries at RH are already on the lower end for the market, and now I've been waiting 18 months for a standard salary adjustment. With COL and inflation, Red Hat is creating a retention risk for high caliber employees by not opening a merit salary increase window within a reasonable amount of time. I am at the 18 month mark, which they say is the longest interval, and still don't know when and if the raises will happen. 

Lastly, Red Hat seems to be hiring a lot of folks from major companies that are now experiencing frequent layoffs, e.g. , HPE, IBM, Oracle etc. This is fine; however, Red Hat recruiting and the managers don't appear to be looking for 'quality' candidates. Just because someone has a big name on their resume doesn't make them a cultural fit or a high quality employee. This is particularly evident with Red Hat's choice of managers. My team has a manager who prior to Red Hat had ZERO management experience. The training they appear to have received on how to effectively manage people is minimal, but no one seems to be providing guidance on how to properly manage the team."

Small company culture, open source proponent which forms grass roots of company culture and following for the who's who of the full stack open source enterprise solutions universe. 

Small voices echo far in this company. Even the smallest idea or concern makes its way far beyond bare metal, chatter, through virtual environments, email correspondence, escaping corporate gravity in true open source fashion to reach the humble kernel at the heart of Red Hat. 

Red Hat, just as its portfolio of solutions for the enterprise proves to be a company poised to georeplicate itself tick by tick with clockwork reliability and intricate focus to detail just as it has since inception of the binary clock. Astonishing as to its pace but with its rules of business clearly defined, the company remains true to itself, honest in its value proposition, to its people, and to its open source roots.   

When I joined company, the company's main campus was still located deep inside the tech triangle in Raleigh, NC, remaining on college campus, deeply engrained in the advancement of education. Red Hat has adhered to its meager beginnings in the sponsorship of upstream communities which transfers to the familiarity and name association within the linux base as well as most other open source communities. The company has grown by leaps and bounds restructuring upon acquisitions and new product/service/support additions to its already impressive portfolio well as to accommodate for the diverse, emerging, and ever growing vastness of both the physical and virtual worlds.

Red Hats's sales support, pre sales, and sales enablement personnel include some of the broadest spectrum of intricately knowledged solutions architects, consultants, TAM's, and sales ops that the world has yet to produce. They take ownership to a whole new level in terms of their company, what they do everyday in most cases is far beyond the standard call of duty. 

I had many of chances to work with some of the founders and minds responsible for some of the ideas and acquisitions that have become part of Red Hat over time. Most of which have stayed on as direct segment product marketing managers and specialized Solutions Architects who are called on to educate, drive product innovation, assure cross platform functionality, to promote ongoing upstream innovation as to support the huge demand of the downstream enterprise market. 

Personality runs rampant through this company, specialized, prideful, and dedicated to inspire and be inspired. The worlds knowledge of Red Hat and overall opinion of the company is evidence of this. Yet Red Hat, although a household name in most shops is a refreshing twist toward modern day take on brand valuation. Never did I get the sense that that I was peddling a namesake or another service that was run of the mill. The internal support that I received always became a team effort when interacting with my clients. A hands on deck. no holds barred approach toward their needs. A win win for everyone and what a great feeling!

Sales are both direct and through the many channel partnerships which helps to give customers as well as teams span contractual confines, aid in pricing and sku flexibility, and better negotiate procurement constraints. There are also embedded software/hardware offerings through OEM markets which round the book, altogether the base of the pyramid in this well structured company provide even keel, a well defined course, agility, and capacity to stay nimble even through tumultuous growth and demanding times.","With every company there is change, patience is key, voice is necessary. Not really a con but within a company who employs some of the smartest people in the world, sets the curve for which standards of new technologies are based and expected to adhere to, the knowledge base is enormous and the pace is intense. I guess the con for me was the wanton will to want to know as much as possible. Word of advice. Be as good as you can at every aspect of your role, be known and take pride in what you are good at, volunteer yourself for opportunities, know the who's who of the company and what they are good at, learn from interactions (the good and the bad), build relationships, and stay on top of your resources."

Red Hat staff generally are the friendliest people ever but the #1 benefit was actually the interesting customers.  Red Hat products are everywhere doing amazing things.  One day you can be at NASA and the next day you may be in silicon valley or NYC.  Opportunity is endless.  Red Hat truly loves to see customers succeed whether the customer uses community or enterprise solutions which is nice to see.

Raleigh is great and Red Hat is worldwide.  I was lucky enough to do some international work which was fantastic - I was even able to arrange relocation to the UK when I married a Brit.  I built some of the best friendships I could have asked for and still keep in touch with several folks worldwide.  I'd definitely love to come back if the right offer came along some day but for now I've been lured away by cashy hipster startups.",Red Hat has become less of a tech company and more of a sales company.  Unfortunately that means leadership sometimes takes the technical people in directions that they lack understanding of.  The latest acquisition or focus may be something that is technically infeasable or out of Red Hat's expertise which leads to the company being spread a little thin at times.  Also salary packages are fantastic but they can't always keep up with trendy startups these days.  Sometimes Red Hat's Open Source stream feels backwards - it's difficult to explain to a customer how they've paid for enterprise support on hardened supported Red Hat products containing bugs that were fixed in community releases a year ago.  Just make sure you pick a few products and learn them inside and out.
794,Red Hat,Open Organization Culture,2016-05-24,2.0,Solution Architect,Red Hat's open culture has a lot going for it in that many ideas do flow freely around the organization.,"However, ""open ideas"" are often vague and not targeted where they can do the most good. They often felt like they were just tossed to the wind, where a few interested advocates would tear them apart. Then they would die and be reborn several months later. Very little closure. 

I actually found teams to be more closed than other organizations I have worked with. My feeling is that emphasis on openness and meritocracy chokes out ideas that are specific and well-founded, but not quite baked. Less assertive team members are effectively silenced by others clamoring for attention. Daily incentives are heavily biased toward individuals and there is very little alignment or teamwork."

There are a lot of different technologies, each with their own culture quirks and technology focus, so you can find a niche that matches your strengths.","Content services (documentation) management is across the board terrible. The director and several managers have no experience in documentation at all, which leads to a ton of quality and team management issues. Additionally, not a single manager has any real people management experience, which has created problems with low-performing employees, retaining (and recognizing) high quality employees, and recruiting, hiring, and training. This creates an atmosphere were senior writers, particularly, are overworked and stressed, and the doc team has a poor reputation with other groups. I would strongly discourage anyone from working in the documentation group, in pretty much any capacity."

At Red Hat it's not what you know, but really who you know, especially sales management! If you think hard work gets you to the top, think again.  Complaining and being seen as a possible HR threat will get you promoted faster than anything.

Supportive, albeit changing (see cons), management chain and it's not a call center role like most other support jobs. You're called an engineer (as opposed to a technician) because you actually get your hands dirty with the technology. Beyond that it looks fantastic on a resume.



CEO cares about the technology behind the company, will randomly drop in on internal mailing list threads getting his nerd on talking about having to compile projects from source for his personal uses.","- If you're good at what you do you'll advance quickly but then it stagnates, the pay is easily 15% below average (or lower). At the end of the day, it is still a support job so it can get monotonous.


Biggest con however is it is losing the ""open culture"" feel that Red Hat is known for as it gets bigger. Management is slowly transforming into the traditional ""top-down do as I say because I say so"" model as they bring in outside management instead of promoting from within."

- There is a lot of room to grow here professionally. If you are constantly on short stent projects you will learn a lot in a very short time, much more than other jobs
- Travel can be a plus, especially in the short term.","- Salary is below market and expect to be making what you started with until you leave. If they like you they will give you stock every 6 months but it is only to try and retain you as it vests a little every year.
- They seem to be a lot more focused on people who are good at BSing to clients than those who are excellent coders and get work done. There is a lot of favoritism toward the first half so the doers tend to get screwed over and treated like crap while the others get promoted straight up the chain.
- Work-life balance is extremely poor, especially if you are traveling. You should expect to live out of a suit case for most of the time you work here and expect to be putting in long hours all the time as Red Hat tends to take on very demanding clients.
- It is very easy to get lost in the system. I ended up on a project where the client kept extending my contract and because of that my managers seemed to forget about me. I no longer had my yearly review, salary discussions, etc. It was also impossible to get off of the project because it was bringing in too much revenue despite the fact I wasn't learning anything and was completely bored.

889,Red Hat,PSE - Fantastic right up until I terminated Red Hat,2015-07-14,4.0,Principal Software Engineer,"I worked at RHT 9 years.

Red Hat at one time was a place where you had ultimate freedom to define your own career.  When I first started and in to about my 7th year I had 100% autonomy.  That all changed, and is one of the major motivators in me departing.  I am not sure if this was a one off or a company-wide trend.

The management team for the most part is competent and looks out for the staff.

There are lots of bright people at Red Hat, especially in the OpenStack BU where I worked.  Red Hat has the best OpenStack development team in the world, so if that is your focus, there is no better place to land.

I learned significantly on Red Hat's dime, especially about team leadership.  I'm not sure any other company would have supported my learning experience as effectively.  Clearly we can't rerun that experiment ;)

Red Hat has a fantastic IRC and mailing list culture designed to implement a globally distributed engineering workforce.  This is its greatest pro, especially if you work from home.","I thought the pay was solid after racking up 8+ years of core+ RSU awards at the PSE level.  I honestly didn't think I could earn more, and Cisco offered 100k more total comp (although the job has slightly more responsibility).  So I guess the pay is bad, even for highly experienced people, although I can hardly complain - my total comp has 5*'ed in the last 10 years.

Red Hat at the PSE and above level is highly political even in engineering, which is fine - its like that everywhere, but if your expecting some daisy dream of no political behavior because Red Hat has open source roots, forget about it.

Red Hat values internal influence more then external influence mainly because many if its staff have wide influence over a variety of communities through their actions.  Internal influence is highly regarded as a result and highly guarded as well.

As Red Hat becomes larger, some managers are out of their depth.  In 99% of cases, a manager will do the right thing for the right reason.  Then there is the 1% action that results in a terrible outcome that is a mistake even a rookie manager wouldn't dare make.

Red Hat believes in the 1:25 philosophy so if you need much hand holding this isn't the place for you.

To keep on top of the system, you have to perform, which may mean long hours especially if ramping up on new tech."
890,Red Hat,"99% awesome, 1% room for improvement",2015-07-24,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Company culture: Love the people I work with to pieces. I have the BEST manager. Laid-back culture (i.e., my managers don't care how or where we do our work as long as we get it done--well). Freedom, courage and accountability are the company's touted core values--a lot of it is also about transparency and openness (duh). Also, it's the first and only company I've ever worked at that gave me the impression that the C-level types actually care what we think. Policies are often made/changed based on solicited employee feedback.

Good benefits: Quarterly bonuses, stock shares are often doled out as a bonus, 401k, etc. etc. 

Beer and food: Plenty of events with beer and wine. And food. Lots and lots of food.

In-house cafeteria: It's more of a cafe/grill. The salad bar is wonderful. Pizza is, meh. Sandwiches are pretty good, and they toast them for you if you want. I hear the entrees are usually wonderful, as are the soups. There are also tons of amazing places to eat all around the building within walking distance. 

Game room: Next to the cafe is a game room with pool table, ping pong tables, foosball, video game consoles, couches, air hockey...and even whiteboards, so you can work and play at the same time if needed.

ATM: In-house ATM (CFCU).

Gym: 10th floor has a gym--one room dedicated mostly to free weights and Nautilus-type machines, the other with treadmills, elliptical machines, stair climbers, etc. The gym has shower/changing rooms, too, and lockers.

Wellness and nursing rooms: Rooms are available on several floors for nursing mothers and for anyone who needs a time out.

Parking garage: Never have to walk out to your car in the rain.

WFH: Some people, depending on your manager, can work from home some. Varies from group to group.","Salary: Unless you're an engineer or marketing manager and such, don't expect to get the top salary in your local area's range. But a lot of times they make up for it in benefits--especially bonuses.

Expense reimbursement: All of a sudden, bam, they started pushing back on it without any warning or heads up, so people are getting burned. This sucks big time and people are pissed. Also, in general the penny-pinching efforts lately are annoying, especially when certain groups get seemingly bottomless corporate cards to spend on extravagant dinners and trips while others have to turn in their parking garage cards and get burned on expenses and can't travel much, etc. 

Some politics: It's not immune to a few asshats who want to ruin it for the rest of us with their petty politics and BS. But for the most part, people don't subscribe to that stuff.

Parking garage: The con is that it's also a public garage, so sometimes you drive for a while looking for a space."

- Good amount of PTO for new associates; however, you are required to use a few PTO days during the company-wide holiday shutdown, and you do not receive any separate sick days, floating days or bereavement days 
- Good brand equity on a resume for future employment opportunities","- Claim culturual values of the company are 'meritocracy' and 'transparency.' However, I do not think this extends to the sales org. Many incompetent people have been promoted based on favoritism and internal politics. Yes, this happens everywhere, but other companies don't claim to have a transparent meritocracy. If RH is going to be like every other company, then don't claim you do one thing and not enforce it by your actions. Actions always speak louder than words. 
- Along with the above, the org sometimes feels a little incestuous for a publicly traded company. They have a lot of RH lifers that are now upper managers and execs that have been promoted WAY beyond their actual ability level solely because they've been with the company a long time. They are now simply coasting in their cushy roles and not motivating subordinates or implementing positive changes...they are content with the status quo so as not to interrupt their gravy trains! 
- Red Hat as a company, and especially sales, is very male dominated. Yes, this is true in technology, but it's especially evident at Red Hat. For example, there are very few women in the channel sales org and field/inside sales. How have they not been hit with a gender discrimination lawsuit? I have been on sales calls where it's more of a ""frat house"" type mentality, with profanity flying and no regard for professionalism, which made me uncomfortable and alienated. 
- Culture of secrecy, gossip & backstabbing is common in sales. For example, I don't know what my 1st line manager and ""director"" actually DO. Again, it seems they are just on a gravy train surfing the internet all day and flying around trying to ""look"" busy, but it's all a facade. I have never once been asked how I'm doing or what I think could be improved. It's very much a ""we don't want to know and don't need your feedback"" type scenario, because providing reasonable feedback would require work on management's part to actually address and make a change, which they've made clear through their actions and promotions they have no desire to do. The people who are promoted are the ""yes men"" types who say everything is great to management, even if they have complained about it in gossip with coworkers. 
- Lots of 'low rent' hires recently. Seems with Red Hat's growth, they are lowering their standards for the sales org and hiring anyone off the street in certain geos. I don't know if this is a talent acquisition team problem, but I've noticed management has an attidue of ""that person will do"" when the attitude should be ""is that person going to be a rockstar in this role & an asset to red hat?"" As a result, several chronically lazy people (to the point where it's laughable) have been hired and will probably be coasting in their current role indefinitely since there are often no repercussions for bad behavior. 
- Compensation is starting to lack. The execs are making out like bandits, but unless you have the right manager to advocate for you, do not expect raises beyond 3-5% (sometimes waiting for an 18 month cycle or longer). This can be frustrating if you are trying to be evaluated on a more regular cadence or are underpaid for your experience solely because you have a manager who doesn't want to advocate for you. 
- Can be very difficult to partner with internal departments to close business - much more so than many tech companies. RH is very legal-driven instead of sales & customer-driven. This creates kind of an arrogant attitude that prevents business from getting closed unless the client meets RH's sometimes absurd demands, even down to basic things like info listed on a PO, order form etc that RH will hold up closing deals for. Red Hat is NOT HP some huge conglomerate, they need to take a customer-centric sales approach and create win-win situations to close business where the CUSTOMER is first. Without the customer, where would the business be? This can be frustrating to navigate for folks coming from companies with more pro-sales mentalities and fully baked systems in place. 
- Too many disparate internal systems for sales org. The way they roll systems out, it's like you are working for a 20 person company based out of a Silicon Valley house. Half the stuff they roll out is broken and glitchy, then you have to do extra work just to accomplish the same task that was working fine before. The rest of the time, they system they deploy doesn't have the functionality the prior system does, so you're forced to use something that actually makes it more challenging to do their job simply because some manager or analyst was trying to justify their own job. 
- Really cheap with company expenses. For example, we went on a trip and the manager had to literally send out 5-10 ""reminders"" about watching expenses, trying to get free food, etc. It came across as ""we don't trust you to act like adults."" They could have easily said, this is the per diem, don't exceed the per diem. Instead, it's like veiled reminders that you shouldn't spend any money (even though we are allotted the per diem), but they don't want to come out and say that directly. The ambiguity makes it stressful and makes it seem like you're not valued as an employee and part of the company, especially when other departments have more of a carte blance mindset."
919,Red Hat,"Decent company, but you won't get rich or move up quickly",2015-05-06,3.0,Business Development Manager,"Good career cache if you're on the tech side, but not so much if you're on the business side. Good benefits. Semi-flexible working environment.  If you love Linux, you've come to the right place. Nice fedoras.","CEO does a decent job running the company but is largely unseen as compared to other companies I've worked with. With few exceptions senior leadership is sorely lacking. There are VERY few (any?) that I'd categorize as motivational leaders that inspire great work. Mostly they are all managers of their own fiefdoms, fighting for their own interests at the expense of the larger picture. Also - they rarely turn over. Mediocrity is allowed to fester. Therefore there is little natural churn of positions leaving little advancement opportunity. If you've got 20 years, great, but there is no apparent fast track to build your career in 2-year incrementally escalating roles. They just don't open very often."

921,Red Hat,The truth about consulting,2015-06-02,1.0,Consultant,"First of all It's important to remember that consulting and engineering are two very different places to work within Red Hat. Many of the positive reviews here are completely unrelated to consultants.

Secondly, applying to be a consultant straight out of undergrad is a completely different beast than applying with previous consulting experience.

-You get to learn a lot about corporate structure and different technology stacks by visiting multiple client sites
-The consultants that last more than a year are actually really great people
-You really do have the opportunity to climb the promotion ladder as high as you want
-Everyone assumes Red Hat consulting has the same talent standards as Red Hat engineering so it looks fantastic on your resume
-Management actually trusts their consultants immensely
-You work closely with some of the worlds top infrastructure technologies
-Red Hat certification exams are highly accessible and paid for","-The majority of our revenue comes from long-term staff augmentation contracts with huge corporations who can't hire their own talent
-Most consultants (especially straight out of college) are sent on 1-3 years of staff augmentation jobs before they're considered ready to actually consult on short term engagements with interesting clients. You may be stuck at the same client site for up to two years.
-You are a slave to the client. The severity varies widely between clients, but vacation time needs to be approved by the client, how you contribute to the team is determined by the client, and when you're expected to work late nights and weekends is determined by the client.
-Revenue numbers rule all: As a billable entity, your needs are frequently swept under the rug so the money keeps coming in.
-Contracts frequently mention that we are all 40hr/week employees which sounds great until you realize that just means we can't bill the client for all the overtime that is actually required but not talked about.
-Training time is offered ...with no time to take it because you're billable (i.e. you can't take any vacation this quarter if you're going on a training)
-Career advancement falls completely on the responsibility of the consultant to study outside the working hours of the client. If you only spend 40-50 hours a week on your career you will never get ahead.
-You get a special ""people manager"" who is responsible for your career advancement, but chances are they will have no time for you. The position is overworked and a low priority to fix.
-Because you're stuck on client site all week, if you ever want to interact with other Red Hat employees, you must do that on your own time."
922,Red Hat,"Great company, very distributed though",2015-04-06,4.0,Software Engineering Manager,"- You get to work with extremely smart and motivated people. 
- Openness and transparency, both externally and internally.","- Red Hat is a very distributed company; a lot of the teams are virtual; the physical distance and difference in time-zones (and even workdays in some cases) makes it very hard to build team spirit, resolve small issues promptly, may completely eliminate casual f2f communication, etc. 

- Another side effect of the distributed character of Red Hat is that many people are working from home regularly. My ""cube neighbors"" are arriving to the office in a frequency of a couple of time a month, or even less then that. 
While I appreciate the option to WFH when necessary, having all of the people always working from home poses the same disadvantages as the ones mentioned above for virtual teams. Arriving every day to a ""ghost office"" is not fun."

Opportunities abound.,"If you or your management aren't within senior managements ""inner circle"" or ""favorites list"" its hard to influence and make a difference.

You may say that is typical corporate life. You would be right. BUT at Red Hat claims to be different based on the open source idea of ""meritocracy: an elite group of people whose progress is based on ability and talent rather than on class privilege or wealth."""
