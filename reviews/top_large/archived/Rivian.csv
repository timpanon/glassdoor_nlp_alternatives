0,Rivian,I plan to retire from here!,2022-03-30,5.0,Group Leader,"Great atmosphere
Great pay
Great benefits
great product","The only problem I have is with all of the expansions, the parking lot is getting smaller"
1,Rivian,Proceed with caution,2021-07-27,3.0,Staff Software Engineer,You get to build around one of the most exciting products to come to market since the iphone. The teams you work with will be incredibly knowledgeable and helpful. RJ gives clear guidance on what is happening all the time.,"Biggest con right now is they're requesting everyone to go back to work when Covid levels are rising. Remote work should be an option for those who have been doing it for OVER A YEAR now without any issues. This shouldn't be a manager driven thing but should the employee want to do such then they have the option, not management. RSUs are a joke - you get taxed on them like crazy and they make it feel like they're a better option than stock options for the employee. Make sure you get a high base pay because a large chunk of your RSU's will get eaten up in standard income taxes vs. long term capital gains (15%) like leadership does. Lastly, company is moving fast so there are a lot of redundant roles being created because one side of the business doesn't know what the other side of the business is doing. This will result in layoffs in the future once people figure out they're building the same things."
2,Rivian,Couldn't be happier!,2022-01-20,5.0,Senior Executive Assistant,"The coolest EV truck on the market! The purpose of this organization makes me proud. The environmental efforts inside the plant- no garbage cans at your desk. Everything is disposed of in appropriate recycle bins. 
Copies and paper usage is at a minimum. If it's on the SharePoint to refer to, no need to print off. 
Cafeteria uses recycled material for containers.
Slack application is used for the #1 communication tool which provides immediate responses throughout the organization.
Stipends for cell phone and WiFi usage per paycheck.
Executives do not have offices, but desks out in the same area as everyone else. 
Office attire is jeans, casual pants and whatever shirt and shoes you are comfortable in. No suits or skirts / dresses required. 
The collaboration between everyone is impressive. One Team, One Climb is seen through interactions and collaborations. 
I love it here!","Huge parking lot, easy to lose your car {at least for me}. They have multiple city-sized buses that run back and forth to the plant almost every 5-10 minutes. Pretty good management for the transportation of staff."
3,Rivian,Real Story,2022-03-07,2.0,Technician,"They Pay Decent
Benefits are cheap","Makes promises, does NOT keep them
Says one thing about schedule in Onboarding, completely different actual schedule
Voluntary work is obsolete, ALL mandatory (12hrs 6 days week)
NO work life balance
Preaches Open Door policy; ALL doors are closed
Does NOT care about worker fatigue
Ask management anything and get no response/ignored"
4,Rivian,Not a place to work if you have a family,2022-02-10,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Pay is nice, good benefits, CEO is very hands on and kind.","You never see your family, working 12 hour shifts 6 days a week, they blame it on it being a ""start up company"" when they are past that stage and in production of their vehicles. You will work those 70-80 hour weeks, just to come home and pass out because you are left with no energy. For your paid sick days, you are given 10 days in a year, they do not adjust or account for forced overtime. You are required to use 12 hours of your time, out of your 80 hours, while the rest of the plant gets to use their full 10 days. They tell you when you are hired that it will be awesome, you'll get super hyped and then they will drain you dry till you have nothing left to give. They are extremely inconsistent, between start times, and supervisors, things are constantly changing, no one can make up their minds and it causes a lot of conflict. Their version of HR is a joke, any concerns or complaints submitted to management are ignored, and you never hear back, almost like they are trained to avoid employees."
5,Rivian,What would you like to know?,2022-03-28,2.0,Assembly Team Member,"If I must admit the place is and has it's good things. Pay is god, could be a little better though with how much they have us all working. Benefits are great. Some management acknowledges you and what you put into work amongst may other things. There is room to grow within the company too.",Communication is a big one here. Along with having us work 12.5 hours 6 days a week. Long hours and the biggest red flag for me is the hours alone. Very indecisive work flow. You never know what time you're getting off work.
6,Rivian,Horrible work life balance. Don’t take this job if you value your family,2022-02-11,1.0,Technician,Test driving fast very trucks,"You will not have a life outside of work. If you love your family do NOT take a job here. They will never see you. They force 12 hours a day 6 days a week and the only reason it’s only 6 days is because the state of Illinois forced them to give you at least one day off a week. 

They will hire new people in making significantly more money than you (6-10 dollars an hour) to do the exact same job as you and expect you to train them. 

The management has no idea how to run a factory or what they are doing. Things change by the hour because no one can make a decision. 

If you bring any of this up to HR ( or people partners as they call them) you will get told we don’t know the answer to any of your questions and will keep telling you that for months hoping you will forget about it."
7,Rivian,Living the adventure,2021-05-08,5.0,Staff Software Engineer,"I have been at Rivian for around one year, and it feels like a lifetime given how things have changed and how the company has grown. 

Rivian has been one of the most enjoyable experiences so far. The culture here goes beyond a set of buzzwords that you would find in other companies (here called Compass values). There are a lot of smart and truly passionate people who do not hesitate to roll up their sleeves and come together to get things done and deliver the best product. RJ comes across as a genuine person and is very approachable. The leadership are not isolated in a tower and are close to the engineers on the ground, and involved in the execution details. The company has taken risks to build an internal technology solution from a clean sheet. This is paying off and enabling the engineering teams to move much faster than other Automotive OEMs. The job requires a lot of commitment, and you need to be able to deal with frequently changing directions. The processes here are sometimes immature. But this is also part of the fun experience of being at a growing start-up, and the company provides an environment where you can voice your feedback and help improve things.","The pay is good, and rather in-line with other tech companies.  However, there are no equity refreshers and there are some restrictive conditions with the RSU grants. In general, there's very little communication on the company valuation or the IPO target date, which is unfortunate."
8,Rivian,Enter with Extreme Caution,2022-03-29,2.0,Anonymous Employee,Clean sheet approach. Awesome environment.,"Lack of inclusiveness. non-diverse group of people, especially the Plymouth location. Rude and condescending leadership where belittling will occur in public during meetings. Senior leadership fired people who did not tell them what they wanted to hear."
9,Rivian,Great Place to Work,2022-03-23,5.0,Analyst,"-Always something challenging to work on.
-Always know I can ask someone for help
-Company is always trying to do better",-Typical growing pains for a company still in it's growth phase
10,Rivian,"Incredible Company, Incredible Product, Be Ready To Work",2022-03-08,5.0,"Team Lead, Workplace Operations","Company Culture
CEO is brilliant
Product is insanely cool
Company growth is skyrocketing","Company growth is skyrocketing... no company on this planet will navigate hypergrowth seamlessly. The team at Rivian is world class, and as prepared as any, but growing pains are real.
The phrase ""drinking from a firehose"" is commonplace... but if you're up for the challenge, and align with the mission, this is your place."
11,Rivian,Love it,2022-03-29,5.0,Controls Engineer,Love the culture and quality of engineers,Should probably focus on battery material sourcing...
12,Rivian,Work place environemtn,2022-03-25,5.0,Vehicle Operations Specialist,Amazing culture that Rivian has built and the company takes care of you.,Start up nature makes constant changes a bit overwhelming sometimes
13,Rivian,GREAT.....but also HELL,2022-01-06,3.0,Material Handler,"Consistent hours, lots of overtime opportunities, good pay, good benefits, great sick leave","The company does not understand work/life balance. Right now I am working 2 weeks straight with 1 day off. Some people don't mind but it does get to be a lot, especially around holidays. Plan on not seeing your kids or family a lot because you will LIVE there. Management and ""team"" environment is OK but mediocre and subpar. Management often times is more so just a title and non existent. The term ""team"" loses its claimed value at the company once you leave orientation. DO NOT COUNT ON ANYTHING THEY TELL YOU! They love to pull the rug from under you a lot so please take everything lightly and don't expect to get everything that they tell you. They promote the people that are the WORST examples.... people that you would probably use as an example of what not to be... this isn't true for all but definitely for most."
14,Rivian,"Awesome Company, with some slightly less desirable qualities.",2022-01-26,4.0,Team Member,"Outstanding work culture, perks, people and pay. I've never worked at any place with such hardworking and teamwork-oriented mindsets. The opportunities at Rivian are endless for those with the aptitude and determination to apply themselves. Alongside that, beats working for a company where for once, you can see the fruits of your hard work by watching happy customers take home some awesome vehicles that everyone had a part in creating.","Being that it's a start up company, I had forseen long hours and weekends to occur, however, not in such high frequency. I have a family at home that I barely get to see anymore and it's destroying me mentally having to put the bulk of the workload at home on my fiancé since I practically live at work. Sadly, we were all sold the lie about a healthy Work-Life balance that Rivian touted at our Onboarding Process and it feels like the only way you can make that happen is if you pour gasoline on your vacation time and set it on fire, after that has been exhausted, you're pretty much screwed. The work life balance they touted is the main reason I came here because my previous job had me working hours similar to this and it wasn't working out well with my daughter being born recently. I feel my employment here slowly dwindling by the day since finding a babysitter to watch my daughter whilst I work long hours and weekends constantly is what is consuming my vacation here and it hurts because I really want to stay employed here but I find it challenging to fulfill the requirements they set out for us."
15,Rivian,Great start-up electric vehicle company,2022-01-14,5.0,Senior Field Specialist,"Great company culture. Diverse and inclusive teams. Great pay. Good for people who are open to change/pivots. Good for those who can work collaboratively with others! Lots of learning. Lots of check-ins and feedback sessions. Good for self-starters, go-getters, and team players with a positive attitude. The team is open and willing to train anyone with a can-do attitude. Good for those who are patient with customers, coworkers, change, and with production wait times.",Lack of vehicles to train hands-on with is a challenge! Waiting on vehicles to be ready for delivery. There can be a lot of information given to you in the first few weeks that you have to navigate and manage - but be patient and you'll absorb and catch up.
16,Rivian,Tons of potential lost in the hands of amateur's.,2022-02-19,2.0,Field Specialist,"You will get to experience some of the cool parts of being in an exclusive company. 
Stock purchase discounts.","The previous mentions of it being a ""boys club"" are partially true. 
Not a very diverse company overall.
No people of color in management in most of the company.
Lack of relevant experience severely damages the employee experience. 
Pay is not competitive for the job itself and no growth potential. 
startup vibes are very heavy in culture, expect surprise trips. 
slow work days as a result of being a new brand leaves team members feeling undervalued. 
management can be questionable depending on the location and department you work in."
17,Rivian,Solid Company With Room For Improvement,2022-03-10,4.0,Team Member,"Pay is solid with many opportunities for overtime
Job itself isn’t difficult
Great coworkers
Fantastic group lead
Great benefits","Hours are rough
Scheduling isn’t great as in you aren’t sure when you’re off for the day until late in the shift
Typically a 6 day work week with 8-10 hour shifts with some departments working 12 hour shifts sometimes"
18,Rivian,no headline,2022-01-12,2.0,Quality Control Inspector,"clean, they give you snacks",In the 6 months I have worked here I have worked enough hours to have worked a full year. In my orientation they stressed how they have a strong belief in their employees having a work/life balance but since then I have rarely worked a week below 60 hours and I have worked several 84 hour weeks all mandatory. At the beginning they would have me here Monday-Saturday but in the last 3 months it has turned into Monday-Sunday and I have only gotten a day off after working 13 days straight. If I have to leave early or take a day off for anything including medical care I have to use my paid time off and I have to use as many hours as they decide what my shift would have been that day. it is always at the least 10. If you only like to get a day off when state law mandates you have to have one then this may be the place for you. I understand that this is not the experience for everyone in the company but this has been the experience of most of the people in my area of the plant.
19,Rivian,Great Place to work,2022-03-16,5.0,Trail Engineer,"I don't work in normal, but this is a great place to work. Nice offices, smart people. Also a great learning experience. People are very dedicated to the corporate values, which is unusual","Not well organized, which makes sense for a new company."
20,Rivian,Good foundations for a great company,2022-03-01,5.0,Manufacturing Engineer,"Work/Life Balance
Inclusive culture
Alot of autonomy
Great CEO and C-suite","Alot of travel if you work at the plant but live in a remote office (as expected)
Growing pains - the hiring surge makes it difficult to find the right people to answer certain questions"
21,Rivian,Great place to work,2022-03-23,5.0,Automotive Diagnostic Specialist,"Great people, pay and outlook",None that I can think of
22,Rivian,Cool environment,2022-03-18,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Work is exciting and fast-paced. People are very friendly and inclusive.,Work can be demanding sometimes.
23,Rivian,Growing pains,2022-01-29,3.0,Anonymous Employee,Great brand mission. Great product. Great moment in time to be with an EV company. RJ has heart.,Some pretty bad executive leadership communication that leads to a feeling of confusion and bewilderment all the way down the ladder. HR department and leadership doesn’t understand how to create supportive and trustful environments yet. Clear growing pains for a team that doesn’t look like they’ve been in this stage of growth before.
24,Rivian,Great Company and Leadership,2022-01-12,5.0,Facilities Lead,"Great colleagues across the board that all seem to share similar work mindsets to come together and over deliver.

-Great and supportive team leadership.
-Large focus on hiring some of the best people in the industry to meet extremely aggressive goals. 
-Work life balance is attainable as long as team goals are being achieved.
-Internal team communication is transparent with future and current goals.","-EVERYONE outside of work will ask you for updates on vehicle production (the company fan base is a bit intense).
-Benefits and/or perks could be better, but I know there are goals to embrace internal requests.
-Super aggressive expansion plans makes some hesitant on how we will accomplish these goals."
25,Rivian,Rivian doesn't care about its employees,2022-03-17,2.0,Anonymous,Rivian is deeply committed to keeping the world adventurous forever and customers happy.,"From significant issues like poor leadership teams (ELT and LT-1), lack of long term strategy, and no improvement to work-life balance, to smaller things such as eliminating the EEAP program, I've become more confident that employees don't matter to Rivian."

27,Rivian,A Great Place for Meaningful Work with Diverse Colleagues,2022-01-12,5.0,Senior Staff Engineer,"Working at Rivian has been by-far the best experience of my career. I have gotten so many opportunities to work cross-functionally and learn so much. Additionally, my voice is heard every time that I have a suggestion or a concern. The leadership team is trustworthy and provides autonomy to the employees so that work is able to get done quickly and efficiently.","Sometimes we move so quickly that if we don't over-communicate, we end up stepping on each other's toes."
28,Rivian,Challenging but rewarding,2022-01-15,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Little to no micro managing, everyone is trying their best, hard work is recognized, feel like my management genuinely cares.","Constant change, underdeveloped/developing processes since certain areas of the company are still ramping up, long hours sometimes, and quick turnaround expected. Now that company is public — even more pressure to perform to meet goals/targets set so shareholders can get their ROI — typical."

30,Rivian,Best company I have ever worked,2022-01-13,5.0,Project Manager,"Projects and products are cool and exciting, the company is still very agile, with lots of opportunities to grow and learn. You feel great about what you are doing, compensation is fair, no micromanagers, leadership is down to earth, plenty of remote work, company is picky about hiring and therefore you typically have great fits and great coworkers, everyone is pulling their weight. Truly an amazing place to work on the cusp of changing the world for the better.","Still very much a start up, therefore expect to put in some work!"

33,Rivian,Best job and company!,2022-02-09,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Rivian is truly the best company to work for. Everyone is amazing and helpful. Everyone cares for each other on a deep level and there is so much growth potential here.,There are no cons working here!
34,Rivian,Amazing experience with limitless potential,2021-05-06,5.0,Engineering Manager,"Rivian as a product and as a company has been amazing to experience.
The company – from day one, Rivian drives home a few concepts. Rivian has the compass – a set of values designed to keep the culture of company during the rapid growth. This is not only something that is talked about during orientation and then forgotten. In every quarterly 1:1 this is discussed, and every action and goal are tied to these core culture value. Aside from that, this is an engineering company, developing something that has not been done before. The expectation has to be that of a start-up. Going into the role, expect to be challenged. There are a lot of things to do and the pace is superfast. Rivian has ambitious goals and it will take a lot to accomplish them. The leadership team is constantly asking for feedback through surveys and 1:1s, and they strive to provide resources for you to succeed. 
At the end I feel it comes down to the individual. You can make Rivian as or bad of an experience as you want. If you put in the effort, learn, be open to change and voice concerns then the experience will be an amazing one. If you keep everything bottled in and don’t speak up, then nothing can change. 
The most amazing part for me, is being able to experience the product. Driving the Truck and SUV allows for feedback into the daily tasks and improvements. It also gives meaning to all the hard work that was put into the product.",nothing that hasn't been address or isn't address
35,Rivian,Extraordinary culture with amazing products,2022-01-12,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Forward thinking teams lead the way, the culture is by far the best that I have been a part of, really focused on well being, great pay and benefits, a diverse group of forward thinkers wanting to change the world for the better.",None that I have experienced thus far other than typical growing pains from start up to major automotive manufacturer.
36,Rivian,Passionate environment top to bottom,2022-02-11,5.0,Systems Engineer,"Clear goals
Passion to get to the goal

 Based on the amount of growth overall and establishing a company of this size can require someone to be able to pivot quickly and be flexible."
38,Rivian,Slowly sinking ship,2022-03-22,1.0,Senior Software Engineer,Comp and benefits are okay.,"Poor communication, lack long term strategy, no w/l balance. Just a toxic place prioritizing business over humanity. Company values are simply performative and marketing."
39,Rivian,I moved here for this?!,2021-12-08,2.0,Manufacturing Engineer,"Great pay, benefits are good, it's a very inclusive environment, clean, the food is decent. Cute town, albeit small and a bit behind the times.","Massive workload, unrealistic timelines, excessive pressure to produce without proving out the process. Flawed product design. Indirect threat of unemployment. No plan for production fallout. Poor resource management(this one is a pet peeve, a lot of people got used to WFH recently but a manufacturing environment requires hands on engagement and oversight. Zoom meetings don't build things, engineers and technicians with boots on the ground and tools in their hands do).  This feel like just another business built to extract every last bit of value from the workforce with very little regard for the human cost. Depression and anxiety are rampant here, sure a degree of stress is healthy and problems will always keep coming up, but forcing people to give up their lives outside of work and to ignore their health, both mental and physical is exactly the type of environment that destroys lives in pursuit of adventure? ""greatness?"". A cooler truck? Not sustainable, not adventurous."
40,Rivian,Not a toxic culture,2021-11-08,5.0,Account Manager,"It’s really damaging reading such inaccurate reviews in the media about the Rivian culture. An assault from a disgruntled employee. Let’s state some facts - I saw WEEKLY videos from this person saying how much she loved it here. She interviewed me AND spent most of the interview telling me how much she loved the culture and how it was the best place she’d worked. 
I do not doubt for one second she will have come up against some bro men. This is America and we have a lot of Bro’s here. 
But my experience couldn’t be more different. I have an inspirational mentor who is a Director in another team, I have supportive male colleagues. SURE could there be more women working in tech and auto OF COURSE, but we have to lead by example. All these negative reviews are doing is ONCE AGAIN stopping women from trying to get into the tech space. 
Most toxic culture in 20 years? Or most toxic culture when someone realised they weren’t doing their job well enough to match the hype they’d curated in the media for years? That’s more like it.","Why is the company not pushing back more in the media? We should stand up and be proud of what we are working here and celebrating the women in the company? 
Ex disgruntled employees who are looking for a check are going to be on here writing things. 
And by the way, didn’t the person who is complaining in the media fire someone on her own team during the summer and that person accused HER of being toxic?! Maybe that’s where she got the idea from?"
41,Rivian,Everything is awesome other than hourly pay.,2021-06-25,4.0,Senior Field Specialist,"Fun and thorough onboarding experience. Very open and communicative culture with an emphasis on transparency, trust, and inclusion. Awesome product and company vision. A genuinely mission driven company which takes action to meet it ecological responsibilities (working towards a sustainable future is more than just lip service here, it's built into an increasing number of decisions and processes). Opportunities to work directly with decision makers and earn personal recognition from leaders of varying levels. Company frequently updates policies to remain competitive and desirable to employees. i.e. recently got rid of 1yr cliff and annual vesting for RSU's. Now there is no cliff and shares vest quarterly.","Low wage: Even with a strong resume and what felt like an awesome interviewing experience, $27/hr was the best I was able to negotiate for my role as a Sr. Field Specialist. From my research, $27/hr is about 10% less than industry average for similar roles and does not feel commensurate of the duties expected, especially when considering the premium associated with living in the greater Seattle area. Also, 4% match on 401k is less than I have enjoyed at other smaller companies with less funding. Don't have enough info to know if this is a pro or con, but my comp also includes $27,000 worth of RSU's which vest quarterly over 4 years."

88,Rivian,Great Products - Even Better Company,2020-02-12,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Rivian is a company with highly talented employees who possess skills and knowledge  from many different industries resulting  in a diverse workforce.  The culture at Rivian is amazing and there are endless opportunities on a daily basis for each employee to contribute to the company's success.  Rivian puts a lot of effort into ensuring that their employees have the right tools to do their job.   The workplace is not only a desirable place to come each day but also one that makes employees feel valued.     At Rivian there is open and comfortable communication  whether you are talking to the person sitting next to you or RJ the CEO.     And to top it off,  the upcoming products are going to be amazing.",With launching amazing products comes a lot of hard work and dedication.   Coming to Rivian this should be expected and not a surprise.   If you are someone not willing to put in the effort than this may not be the right company for you.

There is ZERO family time. Production is the only thing that matters. 7 day schedules with all of them being 12+ hours a day with the promise of the next weekend off that never happens. Deceptive about hiring more people for night shifts. I was hired for day shift and I’m working a constant 7 day, 12 hour swing shift. Management is the biggest buffoons in the entire company. “People MUST volunteer for weekends or they will make it mandatory.” No future for people with a family here unless you’re a suck up to the CEO or VP."
91,Rivian,A fulfilling experience!,2021-05-08,5.0,Engineering Director,"Company’s mission, products, emphasis on culture and sustaining that culture as we grow are some of many great things at Rivian. The expectation to debate passionately in a respectful manner regardless of an individual’s rank is something unique here. And more importantly, committing to the outcome regardless of one’s position during the debate is one of the best reasons for Rivian’s growth and success so far.

As the company is growing, various organization are being structured appropriately to bring work-life balance while maintaining that adventurous spirit of a start up. This could come across as loosing original spirit but I am amazed to see how folks still try to accomplish things together, treat each other with respect after going through such rapid growth.

Most of us who joined the company at different stages know the intense nature of work at an upcoming company with ambitious goals in an established industry.  And seeing that hard work in action, in vehicles, gives a great sense of fulfillment, which is what most of us have sought when joining the company.",The usual small stuff as any other company

95,Rivian,Maternity/Paternity Policy,2021-09-21,2.0,Program Manager,A maternity / paternity policy exists.,"Rivian’s mat/pat leave is disappointing and showcases a lack of knowledge or concern around women’s health care post birth or parental bonding at large. There is conflicting information provided upon talking to a recruiter vs benefits team vs what is circulated at the company. They lean into short-term disability to cover paid leave and supplement remaining (up to 12 weeks, depending on your start date) with their policy. There is no dedicated Rivian policy without first exhausting short-term disability. Firms, agencies, as well as other tech companies are far more competitive. It is disappointing to see a newly launched tech company, with the valuation it currently has, not prioritize this part of employee care. Ask during the recruiting process and get it in writing."

Company is rightly investing in people resources to manage the rapid growth. Highly ambitious company looking to disrupt many industries and also do good for the future/environment.,"Processes have not caught up with the size of company and rate of growth. Ambition/goals currently far outstripping resources that can accomplish it. Not very remote friendly in most departments which severely reduces of of the talent pool available to hire from in a pandemic/post pandemic world (e.g., some functions like hardware and manufacturing obviously can't be remote, but even software engineering departments expects individuals to eventually be back in the office at least part time)."
100,Rivian,Best Decision I Ever Made In My Career,2020-11-09,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Super dynamic and exciting environment, Self-Driving technologies are cutting edge and challenging to develop, I align well personally and professionally with a lot of the goals that leadership wants to achieve, amazing team full of engaged and interesting people to work with.","Not for the faint of heart, this is a place that leans toward work in terms of work life balance but, we are trying to achieve something great, I have found that although I have less free time compared to my previous large company job the time goes by easier and faster as I am fully engaged and excited about what I do every single day. Stress and lack of processes in many ways is something that individuals and leadership needs to manage everyday. This can be exhausting. Success at Rivian really depends on how you feel about the product. If you are like me and see it as the future and love the direction of the company it is exciting and you feel like you have built and invested yourself into something worthwhile. If you don't have this passion for what we are doing this may be a difficult place to work. It is also important to keep in mind that the company is starting out its hard to say if it will stay like this forever but, in my opinion this is when things are the most exciting."

There is no yearly equity/bonus. The management keeps dodging the question, when asked about yearly bonus/equity refresher. It's more like they are not transparent. They have a formal 1:1 called recharge, which people hardly follow. My advice to people, is if they are at the place where work is aggressive and fast paced and you can grow, do not come here. The equities offered here is peanuts. 

Also a note the good reviews in here are all done by the people's team, so do not trust all the good reviews."

The company has a great vision.,"Leadership allows swearing, off color jokes, offensive and discriminatory language during meetings. Some examples include discussions about drugs, sex, stripping and alcohol. If you don’t align or go along with the tone of the meetings, you viewed as not contributing. 
There is special preference for individuals of certain race over others. There is favoritism towards 
individuals who engage with the offensive tone including upward mobility and promotions. 

It is hostile in nature to sit through meetings where offensive language is used and nothing is done about it. It is embarrassing for new team members who are introduced to this behavior within their first few weeks."

Rivian is a really exciting place to work. It is clear what the vision and values are of the company, and respect within the company is truly something that is talked about but also practiced.

You will work with a lot of incredibly smart, passionate people if you choose to work at Rivian. People will want to push boundaries of what is possible, and it's extremely exciting. 

You have the opportunity at Rivian to help build processes from the ground up since most things haven't been done before.

Compensation (both salary and benefits) is extremely competitive.","You are offered unlimited vacation days as part of your compensation which is a slippery slope. At my previous employer, we had a set number of vacation days, but people actively took them. At Rivian, it's difficult to taken any sort of substantial time off as there just aren't as many people who can cover for you.

Work-life balance is not the best at the moment because of the size of the company and the growing demands of each employee. I am optimistic that this will change long term, but it's worth noting for someone looking to join the company in the near future.

There is no set schedule regarding things like cost of living raises (I don't think they exist to my knowledge). So although compensation is competitive, it does stagnate."

Despite repeated request to management that working from home does not mean working 24/7 the work load and pressure to deliver more and more is increasing. Management once in a rare while sends out email mentioning that this much output is not good for health and that we should slow down, however my immediate manager and colleagues are constantly pushing and pressuring to over commit and over deliver. This means I have to sacrifice my personal life working from home and sacrifice my family. I am working 24/7 . My colleagues brag about working all weekends. They send messages on weekends and after hours to review their code. Colleagues want to do video chat after hours and when I ask them that I have to leave I am asked to stay a bit longer. Personal life is suffering, kids are suffering and mental health is suffering. Management is pressuring their direct reports and in turn they push their direct reports. Management knows about this and is happy with the output. Empty emails about slowing down comes in a rare while which is never heeded by anybody. What I have to work on in how much time is decided by my manager and it cannot change. This is another Tesla culture in making."

The CEO is highly regarded, and he can rally his troops to meet any challenge.","As the company grows, dedicated employees who are already working around the clock are being burdened with even more workload than what is humanly possible. As their managers continue to advance, their egos and self-serving ambitions are growing even greater and faster than the company's own ambitions. Pay close attention to the responses from the company's ""people"" team. On many of the posts, they're repeating the same generic message. Zero tolerance for certain behaviors; contact their team to report your concerns. If employees felt comfortable doing that, they wouldn't be venting here in the first place. Why would anyone trust the same team that promised them a people-oriented culture, unlimited time off, and opportunity to advance when they hired on? They can't be believed or trusted. None of the responses address the true issues, such as INSANE overtime -- unpaid, of course, to salaried employees. Or unfair hiring practices. This is not the forum for that, of course, but there's nothing to suggest that the company is doing anything about the core issues. And this is why I left. My health was affected by the hours that I was working, and there was nothing that H.R. could do to change that unless I lodged a FORMAL complaint, that they would then investigate. Obviously, no one wants to suffer retaliation from a manager who already has way too much power to begin with. Or be labeled as the person who threw so-and-so under the bus. That stigma alone will kill your career, no matter where you work."

144,Rivian,What an Adventure!,2020-04-21,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Rivian is the best part of every job I ever had... X10.                                                        
There is an infectious buzz in every office (a buzz I'm missing during our Shelter in Place COVID era!).  At first I thought it was a ""honeymoon"" stage - but it's not.  People at Rivian LOVE the product!  The excitement about what we are embarking upon is obvious.  The ability to make an impact is immense – I believe this is what makes working here the most exciting.    RJ often says ""We are building a truck while we are driving it"".  We are building processes, tools, organizations, programs... and amazing EV's – thoughtfully and with purpose!  Being part of this foundation is extremely exciting.
To be part of an organization that is transparent, diverse, smart, opinionated (yet respectful) and challenging (in all the good ways – ways that foster innovation) leaves me feeling extremely grateful and humbled.","With a company ramping  at the rate we are, and driving towards launch, the only constant is change.  This isn't a con to me, but it may be to some that don't embrace change and realize that it's part of the evolution of a company and product."

- Great product
- SOME highly skilled, smart, and driven people in the company","-Starting to get too political. Some people try too hard to stand out and constantly bark even though what they say is not helpful.
- Super long hours, (60-80+ hrs weekly and no salary/bonus adjustments. New hires, make sure to divide your salary by 60 to get real hourly wages.)
- Terrible work-life balance
- Unnecessarily high hiring spree, 100+ new employees weekly
- Office is meh (used to be a school)
- Bad snacks and drinks which directly affects those who work 60+ hours (we need fuel!)
-Some aspects of vehicle are too focused on design, and lacking function. But design/marketing team doesn't listen to engineers and car enthusiasts."

150,Rivian,Great culture and fulfilling work,2020-12-17,5.0,Associate General Counsel,"Rivian is a place where you can have an impact and create value on day 1. There is a lot of work to get done and you definitely have to work hard, but you have a lot to show for it. This is not a place where work is dictated by process, so you are able to find efficiencies and do things that make sense. For me, its been a perfect opportunity to combine leveraging my experience and using independent judgment to make quick progress. I also appreciate the focus on diversity and inclusion which is shown to be a priority from the top levels of leadership throughout the entire organization.","When we were able to work in the office, it was difficult to find meeting space or quiet space to work. However, the Facilities team has been working diligently to add workspace. I expect that will no longer be an issue by the time the work force is able to get back in the office."

156,Rivian,Extreme pressure to work day and night and pressure to not complain,2021-07-16,1.0,Software Engineer,"- This company could become big, very big
- CEO seems more likeable.","The company culture is a myth. The Line managers in the software side are extremely demanding and think that employees working from home should work day and night. There is absolutely no regard for employees family life. Meetings are regularly held starting 8am in morning all the way up to 6pm in evening. There are actually full day of meetings for more than 7 to 8 hours. Many times skipping lunch to be part of meeting is not only encouraged but the bragged about. The expectation is for engineers to finish their work in evening and night. Line managers and directors hold town halls scolding employees to not work so hard but then the same day organizes one-on-one meetings with each employee pressuring to work and deliver more. My direct manager works 4am in morning regularly and does an all nighter and encourages others to do so. Bad example is set by managers themselves and employees are forced to copy. Director forces managers to not put more time estimation in JIRA project tracking system so that his bosses do not see higher man hour requirements to deliver a feature. However forces employees under him to deliver in super-human like speed. Basically the Director wants his bosses to see that his team can deliver a feature which should take 2 months in under 2 week all the while the employees did not work more than 8 hours a day. Utter disregard for employees family. There are kids in family too who need to go school and picked up. But meetings are held exactly at time of pickup and drop off. The behavior is such that there is no such thing as covid in the world. 200 employees are asked to fly and meet for week in office meetings from 8am to 9pm. With current infections spreading to vaccinated people too..this is going to be a super spreader event. The neck breaking work and the pace will break back of all employees. While Directors and VPs ask employees to take a break, they privately pressure to deliver more. too bad. This is another Tesla or even worse."

The CEO is brilliant, the senior leadership team is well qualified and top notch, and the company's mission is truly authentic and inspiring. One of my favorite aspects about Rivian is the culture. There is a huge emphasis on collaboration and working as a team, and everyone here is passionate about the products we're building. The environment will challenge you to do some of your best work, so it's definitely not a walk in the park. As RJ says, ""we're trying to build a plane and fly it at the same time"". The fact that we're building an EV company from scratch makes it that much more exciting and rewarding.","As with any company undergoing a significant growth phase, Rivian is trying to keep its roots and culture intact which is quite challenging to do. I think in the long term and with continued focus on hiring the right people, we will get there."

The culture of Rivian is professional, while rooted in outdoorsiness and fun. Building electric adventure vehicles is something that many at Rivian are truly passionate about. Our professional culture of ""one mission, one company"" is driven home from the top down. RJ Scaringe is a fantastic leader and an inspirational speaker. He regularly shares the latest information on vehicle development, commercial launch, and broader strategy with the whole company which makes everyone feel involved.","The task at hand is incredibly large. Rivian is a fast-paced company by nature. There will always be more to do, things to do better, and new opportunities. As such, the pace is fast and employees are expected to keep up.

Rivian has been hiring people from different companies and industries, and the leadership is doing a great job in creating an unique Rivian culture, making sure that bringing people from different companies is not influencing and damaging Rivian`s own culture.

I think Rivian has the best balance in terms of being innovative, moving fast and having the right level of processes to help it succeed. 
One of the things I really like about this company is the Rivian 101 culture. It is not something that just feels good to read but is lived in every decision of the company.
The CEO is a visionary with genuine interest in making the world a better, more sustainable place. He has an eye for talent and is not afraid to challenge employees to reach their true potential.
If you like being in your comfort zone, doing something that has been done numerous times, this is not a place for you. This is a place for adventurous people with a strong desire to change the world for better. And as they say, “Adventure is worthwhile in itself.”","Like every other company in this world that is growing rapidly, there are challenges and problems here too.

I can wholeheartedly say this is the most fun I've had in my career. Rivian is a place that is a perfect intersection of technology, purpose, innovation, and talent. It's not for the faint of heart or those who aren't comfortable with the unknown. That's not a bad thing as we are focused on first-principles problem solving and creating our own adventure. This is a company that cares deeply about what we do, but also cares deeply about our employees, families, and communities.

183,Rivian,An exciting company building something new,2020-02-05,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"If you are bored with an established existing business and looking for a challenge, Rivian is for you.  The company is growing very fast to achieve an audacious goal of starting a new automotive manufacturing company.  It's a fresh start to build a new business model, question why we are doing something instead of just repeating what has been done before.  There's a wealth of really talented smart people to learn from and be inspired by.  
During challenging parts of the process I lean into being uncomfortable and reach out to teammates to discuss solutions.  There's a common goal of working together.
The amount of professional growth I've experienced here in one year is equivalent to the seven years at my previous job.  It's a unique opportunity I'm grateful to be a part of.","It's easy to lose focus on why challenges exist as symptoms of a fast growing company. It's easy to focus on why things are wrong instead of what it will take to make Rivian succeed.  If looking for a solution is not a natural habit, you may struggle here. It took me some time to work past this.
If you are very curious, you'll need to manage this properly. I could spend a week learning about what other teams are working on or doing.  It's easy to get derailed on your core focus, learning about something new. It's not really a con for me.  I love it — just something to be aware of if you struggle with self-regulation."
184,Rivian,Culture is everything!,2020-09-02,5.0,Talent Acquisition,"Compared to other large EV companies i've worked at, Rivian does the best at ensuring they take care of their employees and their well-being. Cross functional teams are collaborative and friendly. You don't need to feel intimidated to speak to C level- they are so nice and caring (at the Tesla factory, you were asked to not make eye contact with Elon). The Recruiting team does a good job of screening for culture fit and if you make it through and later reveal you are not a team player, you will be exited. Start up mentality is expected- long hours but epitome of ""Work hard, play hard"" culture. Unlimited PTO for salaried workers and people actually take it! The company encourages adventure and to go enjoy the world we are looking to save. Overall, best company i've worked at! And the products are AWESOME.",Can't think of any! Everyone here is amazing.

The vision is beyond any one vehicle, and to make a positive impact on our world, our kid's world, our kid's, kid's world and keeping the world adventurous forever.

It has been followed strategically/selectively to move the agenda forward and attract talent for cheap. In either case (though Deceptive), using a people policy to strategically motivate team is a better approach. (though the company is still learning it at your expense, I hope its only a growing pain. Does not become systemic of Rivian)","1. The lofty ideals in paper, does not materialize in reality.

RJ espouses and inspires an overwhelming positive, caring, passionate mentality in the company that really does trickle down the ranks of the teams. He is truly one of those servant leaders who sets the tone for the company. Rivian is passionate about the people who work here and truly committed to the wellbeing of the employees and the success of the endeavor. 

There is an atmosphere that engenders radically thinking about the automotive space, that openly promotes every employee to apply first principles, be creative, bring the best of themselves, and develop the product that the world needs. The company is full of an immense number of really smart, passionate people, and it really feels like there is no limit to what we can do in-house. 

Rivian really does ""walk the talk"" - leadership and the heart of the company truly does care about people, the environment, and inspiring adventure. This makes it a very rewarding place to work, and it also makes it really fun. The product we are developing is so exciting, and it may sound odd, but I honestly feel privileged to get to work on it. There are days that I can't believe how lucky I am to be doing such a cool job (I get to be in-vehicle a lot, working directly with the product and taking it to some pretty epic locations).

To add a final note due to the events of the past year, Rivian has been extremely caring and supportive of all the employees and has taken a strong stance to protect the team.

My role is challenging and I’ve made some friends here,Where to begin without giving away confidential information? Let’s just say things are not going exactly to plan. During the shutdown they promised no layoffs which was great. Then they announced they fired 40 people for performance reasons. Why could they not wait until things settled and why announce it’s for perforence why throw shine on people your terminating during the crisis. Why even announce it? Then the move to Irvine which is starting to look like a method to reduce the number of product design people who will not want to move because we need less of them now. Then there’s the Tesla accusations and all of a sudden we’re not the good guys. But the cherry on top for me is the SVP Product and Engineering (who hired me) and is an auto legend literally disappeared one day and a few days later we are told there is a new guy coming to dave us.

But for me, even more important than the products is the company's focus on building a culture that makes it a great environment to be a part of. Leadership 'walks the talk' and makes tough and sometimes unpopular decisions but I genuinely feel they're for the good of the company. The CEO and leadership team are approachable and this openness has helped create a culture that is inviting and collaborative.","Mentioned above, but there are growing pains associated with a business that is growing so quickly. I have seen the company go from ~750 people to more than 2000 and this means there have been bad hires, broken processes and communication gaps. I feel leadership either works to fix these issues (as I mentioned above) or is actively working to address them now."

What I love at Rivian is that we are not only building vehicles, but we are building an end-to-end technology platform and starting from a clean sheet. I had the chance to meet a lot of talented and creative people, with a great energy and a high motivation to change the car industry and have a positive impact on the planet.

Huge opportunity to learn and expand your understanding beyond your core area of expertise.

Very dynamic environment - lots of decisions to be made. If you are willing to take ownership there is huge opportunity to grow.

Culture -  The company culture was great and there are still individuals working hard to keep it alive!","Culture - With the company growing so rapidly the bar on hiring has gone down. This is especially true for leadership. Newly hired leaders do not respect the company culture that existed, and all new hires they are bringing in are similar.

Lack of communication - With so many work locations there is no good mechanism to provide progress updates at a company level. Very few company-wide or department meetings or channels to share information so as an employee you can feel left in the dark."

231,Rivian,Busier and better than I imagined,2020-05-10,5.0,Software Engineer,"RJ cares a lot about people. I was surprised to run into him in the kitchen a couple months after I started and not only did he stop to say hello, he knew my name and where I'd come from. Then he offered me half of the peanut butter sandwich he'd just made on his way to his meeting. That never happened at the last OEM I worked for. The bar is high here and the opportunities are endless for those who are up for the challenge. It felt like a big risk leaving my last job for Rivian, but now I realize the risk was in not taking a chance on this place. I'm doing the most interesting work of my career.","Leadership needs to keep working at preventing silos that traditionally pop up, but from the last few all hands, sounds like that is a big focus."
232,Rivian,An opportunity of a lifetime,2020-02-25,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The mission: We're building not just one, but *three* carbon zero vehicles. I am thrilled to contribute to an organization that doesn't just want to make beautiful products, but also believes it is a moral imperative to do right by our planet.

The people: Coming from other industries, I adjusted to the cynical and jaded attitude that came with the territory. Arriving at Rivian was a breath of fresh air--immediately I felt the warmth of midwestern hospitality (Plymouth is currently our largest population out of our offices). Most folks are decent, kind, and empathetic. In my first week I received an email from a colleague who I had yet to meet in person, saying they were glad I was here (and I'm not ashamed to admit that I cried upon reading). 

Leadership: Getting to know, and work closely with, senior leadership has offered me firsthand accounts of how much this cohort cares about the people on their teams. I have personally felt incredibly welcome by senior leadership, and have only seen a willingness to engage and communicate. Their intentions cannot be doubted, but Rivian's leadership capabilities are being tested (more on that in ""cons"").

Accountability: The external narrative around recent leadership changes might make our environment seem more unstable than it really is. Unlike most companies that espouse a ""sports team"" mentality, Rivian truly lives it. We will not have misaligned or problematic leaders (even those with ""C"" in their title) overstay their welcome. Even though the short-term disruption of these changes are felt and non-negligible, they will help to ensure the long-term health of Rivian. I can see how these kinds of changes (even when necessary) can be jarring, but I personally only see the upside in decisive leadership changes.

The work: This is a place where I believe I can make a difference (this is less about my own confidence and almost entirely about how incredibly supportive my colleagues are!). I've been enabled to chart my course and have not yet run into commonly frustrating roadblocks like headcount restrictions, oppressive budgets, or micromanagement. Having said that, your mileage may vary here. I'm very fortunate to work on a team that's very enabled, but I have the sense this is potentially less true in other parts of the org (whether justifiably because of regulatory reasons, or because of leadership issues.)

Compensation: All things considered, compensation is competitive, but ultimately I took a pay cut joining Rivian. It's a startup in every sense of the word--without cash flow we can't (and shouldn't) pay beaucoup bucks (this might be especially noticeable for Silicon Valley talent who are used to the salary arms race; if comp is a major factor in your decision-making, Rivian will likely fall short of your expectations and you ought to look elsewhere). All full-time employees receive stock (there are still some folks waiting for their grant, but I hear it's coming), where we hope to see more meaningful financial upside in the future. I am listing this as a pro because I think Rivian endeavors to pay competitively and fairly with respect to market standards.

Benefits: Fully subsidized snacks and beverages (gummy bears and the chocolate covered almonds are my favorite; lots of fresh fruit available if you err on the healthy side of things). Partially subsidized meals (usually via catering or food trucks). Unlimited PTO--reading other's reviews it's clear there are mixed feelings. Coming from my last company who also offered unlimited PTO, this is a huge plus for me, though I understand the concern of being able to actually use it. So far I have not encountered an issue with taking time off when I need, and hugely appreciate the flexibility in doing so without the anxiety of managing PTO accrual.","Lack of infrastructure: We are improving here (mostly by focusing our hiring efforts to ensure teams are appropriately resourced), but we are working very scrappily in almost every way. Standards and processes are in their infancy so this means a lot of back and forth while figuring out who does what, decisions being made at the last minute (which has undeniable domino effect on teams), and varying outcomes in quality. As a result, day-to-day at Rivian introduces more friction than not, but I have faith that this will improve over the next year or so.

Diversity and inclusion: Like many companies in the automotive and tech industries, diverse demographics leave quite a lot to be desired here. In a very large new hire class of nearly 40 people, there were three women (yikes). We also have a glaring blind spot when it comes to how we market our vehicles (read: lots of white men going on adventures). I am comforted with Helen's (our CPO) proven background in investing in this kind of work and hope to see more movement and standards on this front, though I think it might be a little slow to start as we focusing on hiring in other areas.

Work/life balance: I vacillate with being critical and empathetic to the company's situation. If you lean toward ""intense"" on the work scale, Rivian will do very little to dampen your enthusiasm (thus long days). On most teams, it is up to you to determine what a sustainable load or day looks like. I personally have not had issues with establishing proper boundaries with my teammates or leadership, but can see where dependence on your team/leader can be an issue when requesting time off.

Benefits: Rivian, in many ways, has the trappings of a large successful company. With an impressive office in Plymouth, huge factory in Normal, and campuses (soon to open) in Palo Alto and Irvine, it's easy to think the amenities and perks like its Google and Facebook neighbors will be offered."

Although there is an incredible amount of work to do, it's refreshing to see an eclectic group of experienced professionals come together with common goals along with such positivity.  We are doing great things and I've never been so excited to make an impact and execute.  There is great energy in our offices.  I literally love my job.

Although we are scaling rapidly, there is very little bureaucracy.  Many of the teams are quite horizontal and people are treated equally, which is very important to me.  No one is inaccessible and everyone seems eager to attack issues, not each other.","Working at Rivian isn't for everyone.  It's challenging and you have to work hard (but work/life balance is promoted).  To be successful, some key traits are evident: humble/selfless, dedicated, ambitious, entrepreneurial, collaborative.

241,Rivian,Working Towards A Better Future,2020-10-21,4.0,Manager,Passionate and like-minded people working for sustainability and clean energy. Rivian attracts top talent and has a lot of potential to succeed in the automotive industry. It's refreshing to be in an innovative company at the forefront of technology while building not only a vehicle but an entire platform/brand. Company culture is heavily emphasized by the CEO who has set a good example for the rest.,"For a startup, the benefits are subpar. Even with an entire team dedicated to improving benefits and putting a plan around equity, we still have seen nothing for a year now. They are very stingy on handing out company shares and equity is continuously diluted. The lack of a RSU refresh program is disheartening and incentive to stay is definitely not strong for high performers. Many employees who started early (before the Amazon partnership) took on a lot more risk and helped build the foundation of Rivian but people who joined later seem to receive similar compensation. How is that fair?

For the amount of funding we have from investors, it's extremely surprising that they refuse to provide a decent lunch to everyone especially when the days are long and people work very hard, a lot of times through lunch. Instead they came up with a terrible subsidized food truck program that was supposed to provide ""world class healthy food choices"".... an absolute disaster and rather insulting actually

Overall, it's a start up environment and we all want to see Rivian succeed so we put in all our time and energy to build the company together. However, it doesn't feel very rewarding to many of us. Instead, it's starting to seem that the company would nickel and dime the employees while leadership reaps the benefits"
242,Rivian,Best place I've ever worked at,2020-07-07,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Working at Rivian is unlike any other place. The level of collaboration and focus on the mission is unlike anything else I've ever experienced. The company has huge plans for the future and the impact to the world will be immense. At the same time, the company is focused on culture and the fact that ""the end doesn't justify the means"". There is a tremendous level of respect in our daily interactions and how we treat each other. At the same time, the company drives decisions based on healthy debates and everyone is allowed to express an opinion and be heard. 
The CEO is an absolute visionary and is also deeply caring about the employee experience, and the impact the company has to the world and the environment. He is engaged in the details to know what is going on and he is incredibly inspiring, motivates people to bring their best self to work.
Rivian is innovating in more than just the product side, the people team is focused on bringing truly new age management based on science and not ancient methods (like stack ranking people). The performance discussions are geared to be based around feedback and not tagging people with a number. This has been recommended by experts for years but very few companies are willing to innovate in this space.","The multiple locations can make collaboration challenging and the company is actively working on creating fewer centers of gravity.

The IT department is probably the worst that I've had the displeasure of working with.

The company suffers from all the problems of a giant corporation and a tiny startup with none of the benefits of either.

If you dig through their LinkedIn, you'll find that a large portion of their employees are people who washed out of Tesla.

As an engineer, this is a motivating company to work for. There are multiple engineering projects underway, new technologies and a constant drive to innovate. As a result, there is always new interesting work to sink your teeth into. 

The leadership team is constantly looking for bidirectional feedback and striving to better themselves and the company. Employees are offered many opportunities to develop individually with new challenges always available. 

Finally, with the company’s success, it is inevitable that it will need to grow quickly. The emphasis on recruitment not only focusing on strong technical capability, but also cultural fit means that your colleagues are always intelligent, friendly, engaged, and easy to work with.

If you're the kind of person that needs everything pre-packaged and perfectly ordered, maybe Rivian is not for you."
265,Rivian,Great place to work. Great product,2021-03-02,4.0,Senior Embedded Engineer,Great place to work. Great product,Too early for me to comment
266,Rivian,Love working here,2020-04-11,5.0,Software Engineer,"Rivian really cares about the environment and culture it is building. This is driven by the CEO and he backs his words with actions. The CTO and some of the senior leadership were recently let go. This kind of decision shows that the company is committed to culture and what we are building. Direction is clear and mood is strong (reviews stating otherwise are just not true). We have a lot to do, and this makes for a fast paced and fun environment.","Timelines are aggressive as we work toward launch, and a lot of hours are needed."
267,Rivian,Very Exciting Place to Work,2020-06-09,5.0,Lead Structural Durability Engineer,"Very exciting place to work where we developed very enhanced CAE procedures differentiating the load cases pertaining to Stiffness, Strength and Fatigue for all durability CAE load cases.
A right mix of engineers with different capabilities.
Good leadership team, always support in development of internal standards to make a successful product.
Good opportunity to work on different subsystem level and vehicle level.
Adventure products are more exciting which will have the outstanding performance.",Certainly Rivian being a growing company it has limited resources. For a person with passionate to work will never see this as a con.
268,Rivian,Working at Rivian - part of the family,2020-10-19,4.0,Supply Chain,Excellent company culture. I completely trust the leadership team and get along well with all coworkers. Lots to learn and very little micro-management by superiors.,"Standards are very high and the workload is immense. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but something to consider as a prospective applicant. This is NOT and old-school, slow, bureaucratic, legacy auto maker. Rivian, much like Tesla, moves quickly and requires employees to be flexible, patient, and intelligent. 

This is NOT a company to ""rest and vest""."
269,Rivian,Truly the best company I have ever worked for,2020-02-22,5.0,Engineer,"Rivian is a highly empowered environment. You will get out, exactly what you put in- Period! Rivian is for multi-rolled, highly motivated, overachievers. People who don't require maintenance pats on the back.  People who keep their heads down and stay focus on the task at hand: Building a new company from scratch! These types of teammates make up the majority of the 2000+ here

Unlimited vacation is beautiful, it alleviates the stress of keeping track of how many days left, or how many sick days or personal day you have.

This is the company superstars dream of.

You will have the opportunity to advance in your field and/or get involved with any area of the company that you can add value or growth to. Access to leadership is key here, even RJ will stop and talk to anyone at any level and actually listen. Company equity ensures that all employees have a stake. 

Non-performers will be called out, and given the opportunity to improve and grow. But in the end, they tossed if they fail. This includes talented people who let ego or personal gains are in the way of our greatness. You will get pushed out like a virus. 

One other awesome thing: the CEO is not a fame seeking or narcissistic. He is a genius from MIT who has been designing this company in his head since he was 12

I love-we all love- that a title will mean as much as the janitor's title if you do not add value or leadership. This is not a place to show up and expect the world or expect that your last job or title means much. Especially if you are a whiner or a pointer instead of a leader and a doer. You have to produce at all levels, otherwise you will not make long.  

Rivian is 100% worth the jump, if you are ready to go all in and help us change the world.","It requires long days and nights at times, this is not a day job, 8-5 will not cut it. This is not a place for the average or weak person. It will take sacrifice and focus to win. If you have a family or life that is not aligned, you will have some struggles. 

We are not making money yet, so promotions, raises and bonuses aren't given often  like at a reg company. (But they do happen)

Fast change and adaptation can be very frustrating, but we would not be here if we were slow and content. 

Fast growth has affected the culture, this was inevitable. 

*I have seen a manipulation going on with bad reviews here... take note, this is obviously one or two employees who have issues with their focus and lack the tact to go face to face with RJ to address their issues. This is embarrassingly obvious. I would expect more, but worms will be worms, and worms get eaten."

As the company scales rapidly, there is massive opportunity for talented people to take on more responsibility.

If you bring an ownership mindset and are ready for the long climb ahead of us, you'll grow your skills through experience that's hard to find anywhere else. 

This is still a workplace (not a family), but the company has a humanity that keeps us focused on doing right by people during difficult situations. This flows from who RJ is and how much he cares about people.","We work hard. That's a con for some people. If you want to have impact, opportunity, and growth, expect to work hard."

285,Rivian,"Most rewarding job I've had, never a dull moment",2020-02-12,5.0,Senior Product Designer,Rivian is a very fun and exciting place to work.  I never find myself counting down the hours or looking at the clock.   It is a very collaborative environment where you can affect change no matter what level you are.  Leadership really encourages healthy debate which is very refreshing for an automotive company.,"Could be seen as both a positive or a negative, but if you are person who requires lots of process and direction probably not the place for you.  But if you want to be part of creating a process and like to be autonomous, you will thrive."
286,Rivian,Honestly people need to calm down,2020-02-15,3.0,Senior Software Engineer,Yes RJ is a nice guy.  Many of my coworkers are nice normal people.,It’s the kind of place where you need to be very careful what you say if you have any criticisms or problems.  Dissent is not tolerated. You either are 110% committed or nothing. Other than that it’s pretty standard. Office move to Palo Alto shows that there is little concern for who’s currently here -  all in the quest for better tech talent.

291,Rivian,"a challenging, exhausting, sometimes stressful, but absolutely unbeatable workplace",2020-02-06,5.0,Engineer,"RJ (CEO) has a clear goal in mind, which is to enact a positive change on the environment in which our children and our children's children will grow up.  This is not just a sales pitch, it is absolutely genuine and is the cornerstone of the company vision. Ultimately that's what attracted me and many others to Rivian and there are few, if any, companies in the world right now able to deliver the same extent of positive change. Yes Rivian is a startup and is now experiencing typical issues associated with the necessary growth that enables success, but the opposite (no growth and a static work environment) would bore me to tears. It's a constant challenge of strong growth, mixed international cultures, experienced and inexperienced employees, old and new employees, changing organizational structures, new investors, new technologies, and brand new vehicle concepts, but it's these same challenges that allow the opportunity to do things differently. Rivian is growing and adapting, whilst building amazing products, and there is no place more exciting to work in the world right now. For those who are frustrated by it, I strongly believe the better response is to embrace it, grow with it, and try to affect it positively over time. Eventually it will all calm down and you will miss this phase.","It's extremely difficult to build a car company and it's not for everyone. There are often causalities to the pace, the rate of organizational change, the dilution of culture and the relentless drive to maintain timelines to keep customers happy. Most work long hours, but are generally driven by a desire for success in what Rivian is trying to do. The average employee at Rivian is robustly capable with a strong desire to be influential in Rivian's success, but these types of personalities need strong, experienced management. This is difficult to build immediately in a startup and is the toughest of challenges for RJ and his leadership team. Whilst Rivian grows at an extraordinary pace, they are constantly working to refine how the business is run, unfortunately there is still plenty of room for improvement"

298,Rivian,This place will make you better.,2020-02-04,5.0,Strategy Analyst,"I've always loved that Mr. Rogers quote...“When I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me, ""Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.”

I joined Rivian because it's an organization of helpers. First responders in the form of designers and engineers, scientists and fabricators, accountants and laborers, surfers, mountain bikers, snowboarders, hikers, great-outdoors-loving people who run towards a problem rather than wait for someone else to solve it. I joined Rivian because it's not enough to look for helpers, it's more important than ever to be one of them.

I have a hard time telling people I work for a car company because I think cars are the least impressive thing RJ has built/is building (which is saying a lot because those vehicles are super cool.) What he's done so selflessly, so relentlessly, is build the kind of organization that attracts big hearted people with overflowing ambition who stubbornly want to leave this planet better than they found it. He's given us the tools and space and leadership to do the impossible. Most importantly, he's in the thick of it with us. His humility is unmatched. His optimism is contagious. 

I cannot wait to see what this company does next and I'm incredibly grateful for the opportunity to be a part of this team at this very moment in our story. But we have a lot of work to do and we're going to need more helpers!","When people ask about work life balance, it's hard to answer because it all depends on what you consider work and what you consider life.

This place isn't for everyone. It isn't a 9-5. We're building it from scratch. What we are trying to do has never been done before. Change can get messy. We're not only developing products, we're building an organization that looks for every opportunity to do things a little better than they have been done before. There's a lot to figure out but for some, that's the fun part."

304,Rivian,"Challenging and Exciting, Gut the Politics",2020-02-10,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Never a dull moment at Rivian. Our upcoming vehicles are extremely well positioned and we are gearing up for our production launch. Plenty of opportunities to grow as we tackle problems and bring cutting-edge technology to market. We have the cash and the vision to bring our products to market-- the latter is something you rarely find in the auto industry. 

RJ's leadership and vision at Rivian is something you won't find anywhere else. Look at the investors we've brought on, the partnerships we've forged and the leadership that has joined us from Ford, Tesla, Apple, McLaren and many more.","Launching a new company, with new products, and a new team isn't easy. Over the past year, we've grown a ton, this included a massive restructuring of certain teams and often resulted in management changes. If you read the reviews on here, its easy to see that some people were left behind or resulted in teammates being let go. Some of the new hires worked out, some didn't -- Rivian isn't afraid to admit hiring mistakes. However, Rivian needs to do a better job explaining group restructurings and make it clear why some people didn't work out.  

Our facilities are overcrowded- they are working on this, but the status has been the same for the last 10 months. We have the resources. 

Politics can be real on teams, some managers are over their heads and instead of working to better lead their teams, they make power moves with their high-level peers. People can get thrown under the bus with this sort of behavior and HR doesn't do anything about it. While we are trying to move fast, this behavior needs to be squashed.

Work/Life balance is nothing surprising. This is an automotive startup on the cusp of production, we have a lot of stuff to finish."
305,Rivian,"Inspiring mission, passionate people, rewarding work",2020-02-12,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The authenticity and passion that permeates the Rivian culture, from the CEO on down, is inspiring and contagious. There is a drive to make the world better for our kids' kids' kids, not from a place of ego, but instead from a genuine and intense sense of care and compassion.

Though I didn't know when I joined, the people I work with at Rivian are incredible - interesting, great at what they do, humble, and passionate. Though it gets harder as we scale, bringing in people who are strong cultural fits as well as highly qualified for their roles is core to maintaining our incredible culture. I can go to any Rivian office and easily connect with coworkers I've never met before.

The vision for the company and the brand is clear, and the willingness RJ (CEO) has had to challenge vehicle design, projects, and employees who don't align with the vision or culture is admirable. Rivian is clear about what it is - we don't try to be something we're not for the purpose of getting attention or gaining favor.

Because there is so much to do, there is an opportunity to gain experience outside of your core responsibilities and make a meaningful impact quickly. It's fun to question what's been done and be able to build from a blank slate.","Working at a rapidly growing startup comes with its own set of challenges, like lack of defined process, ambiguity, and a ton of work to be done. Work-life balance can be a challenge, but the excitement and passion for the work provides continual motivation. 

Working at a startup is not for everyone, but there is no place I'd rather be."

As Rivianites the pay is average. There’s no bonus. You get a little stock, health care is standard. Basically it is what it is - kinda cheap as it should be. Some people are cheerleaders and they think we’re curing cancer. Then we have the polar opposites who are here looking for fame and fortune and will kill you if you get in their way. My advice to my friends is do your job and don’t expect too much."

- Fun work culture where everyone is contributing to the success of the program
- Fast paced environment where progress can be measured daily instead of quarterly
- Not bogged down by bureaucracy
- Each employee has a great deal of responsibility to contribute to the team","- It's a start-up , so it is expected that you will be providing value to the organization.  If you aren't, you won't fit in here.
- Each individual has a greater degree of responsibility than a typical large organization, this can either be empowering or debilitating depending on your mindset."
334,Rivian,Very good company,2019-09-21,5.0,Validation Engineer,"Pay, benefits, work environment and people",None. It s a great place to work
335,Rivian,Poor impulsive management,2019-11-25,1.0,Anonymous Employee,I can’t think of any.,Terrible management driven purely by politics. The ones that are good at with the sweets talks (but not actions) are often promoted. Lots of hire and fire. People are often let go for no legitimate reason.
336,Rivian,Fast-paced company,2018-04-03,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Environment: The company believes in and fosters teamwork, and strives to be uplifting in the way it treats people.  Curiosity is encouraged, and the opportunities to stretch are openly available.  There is constant effort on big picture focus.

Work: With the automotive industry on the brink of a series of major disruptions, the company is actively engaged in developing technology and business solutions that address not only today's automotive needs, but anticipates also the needs of a future with massive potential.  Rivian is engaged in business, engineering, manufacturing, data science, and R&D activity in areas including autonomous driving, large-scale  rechargeable batteries, Mobility as a Service.  

People:  The company sets a very high bar when it comes to asking skilled and knowledgeable people to join its ranks.  In addition, they must have the additional qualities of treating people with respect,  being progress-oriented, having active listening skills, thinking big, allowing first principles and values to drive actions.  Of course, hiring mistakes are occasionally made, but the company appears to react very quickly when they do occur.","Mid and lower-level goals are constantly shifting to accommodate the dynamic natures of a start-up companies and major industries undergoing significant changes, which can lead to a lack of rigidity of assignment definitions and their deadlines.

The company has an unlimited vacation policy."

338,Rivian,Great company with great leadership,2015-12-22,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I recently made the move to join Rivian from a technology company. At first, I was very hesitant to make a move to join an automotive company (since I've never worked in one before) but after hearing about what Rivian is doing, along with meeting some very smart people that work here and sitting down with leadership it made my decision pretty easy to make a move once an offer came along. Very fun environment where you can interact with everyone from engineers to C-level on a very casual level. We're also a flat organization without a ton of hierarchy so your voice can be heard. If you have a great idea - bring it up! It's likely that you can present it right to leadership and have a great discussion on how to implement your ideas.","Fast moving and can be ambiguous at times, but what startup isn't? You could be working on something for a couple of weeks only to learn that needs have shifted. You have to be ok with working in a flexible environment and putting in hours to make it work here."
339,Rivian,Great company - amazing future!,2019-03-07,5.0,Engineer,"Opportunity. The ability to grow, take on new challenges, do exciting things and really make a difference is incredible. I've never worked with a better team, love our product, and feel proud of what I'm doing.",There is a lot of work to do and it is hard to ever feel like you are ahead.
340,Rivian,High Growth Opportunities,2015-05-13,5.0,Business Analyst,"Despite being young in my career, I have been given the chance to take responsibility in a high breadth of projects. I am living and breathing the philosophy “learn to swim by jumping into the deep end of the pool”. Although attempting to tackle a new problem on your own can be intimidating, experienced members of the team are almost always available to give support and insight. Our CEO is open to bringing in third party subject matter expertise for projects where internal resources are lacking, and I’ve been empowered to manage those teams. I feel myself growing exponential with Rivian’s progress as a company. I can only predict more and more exciting projects are coming, and those projects will need motivated, friendly people to tackle them.","Ideas and direction can change frequently. While perhaps frustrating at first, keeping an open mind is absolutely necessary in pursuit of the excellence Rivian demands."
341,Rivian,Toxic Culture,2020-01-23,1.0,Engineer,Lot’s of funding. Generated lots of excitement outside the company.,Horrible culture and politics everywhere. Worst HR I’ve ever seen.
342,Rivian,Wonderful People and Talented Engineers,2018-09-02,5.0,Powertrain Intern,"The company culture is incredible. Open, interdisciplinary collaboration means that even as an intern I was able to voice concerns and have them taken seriously by experienced engineers. They treat interns nearly like full-time employees. While there is an understanding that you are learning, you are given serious responsibility and independence, and you are expected to contribute value. Knowing that your work has an impact on the final product is a big source of motivation. 

The talent that Rivian attracts is top-notch. Entry-level engineers have amazing abilities, drive, and talent, and older engineers or management all have experience at high levels at other companies. 

Things change very fast, which is exciting - progress can be seen every day.","Things change very fast, which means that goals may change and the scope of projects can increase; it can be hard to keep up. Roles and responsibilities may not be clearly defined, which can lead to some chaos. On the whole, this is beneficial to a dynamic startup, but can be a bit difficult for an intern to get in the flow of things. Make sure to clarify questions as you have them!"
343,Rivian,I can't imagine ever working for another company – I love it here.,2015-04-09,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Rivian is a place where the team is truly greater than the sum of its parts. People are empowered to lead, make decisions, and shape both company and product. My co-workers are among the hardest working, most intelligent, innovative people I've ever worked with. I've never been around a more optimistic group of people who care about what they do every single day. Our CEO, RJ, leads by example, driving us to differentiate our design and never accept the status quo for product, corporate culture, or anything else. I consider myself lucky to work in a place where I can make a difference, grow my skills and responsibilities, and be part of an awesome team.","The hardest part about working at Rivian is that everything we’ve been doing is under the radar, making it hard to tell people about who Rivian is. I’m excited for this to change soon."
344,Rivian,Awesome exposure to the big picture,2015-05-07,5.0,Engineer,"Rivian has created a creative and collaborative culture that reflects the positive and opportunistic attitude of their CEO.  Every employee is immersed in the strategy of the company and has equal opportunity to contribute towards a successful execution.  New ideas are evaluated based on their merit instead of blindly following the legacy processes established by the automotive industry.

From a ""perks"" standpoint, there is a stocked snack cupboard and ample room to run your RC car outside.  Vacation schedules are flexible to accommodate any reasonable request.  Also the occasional tossing of the football outside helps to keep the creative juices flowing.","In a company with constantly evolving ideas and processes, it takes the right personality to embrace the power of change.  The perpetual change can be seen as frustrating until you commit yourself to the process of continuous improvement."
345,Rivian,"Fast paced, Fun",2015-07-22,5.0,Manager,"I wanted to work at Rivian for that start-up atmosphere with some of the best automotive thinkers in the Industry, and it has not disappointed. Rivian's core principles foster a learning environment filled with responsibility and accountability that you wouldn't get at an already established organization. Additionally, working for RJ is a blast and you will find no other leader that truly knows the work and how it should function. With his hands-on management style, the team takes on multiple hats which breeds a beauty of a cross-functional organization.  

Furthermore unlike any other company I've seen, fun is a real thing at Rivian. Teammates get together often for lunch, but also after work or on weekends to hang out. The friendly culture extends outside of the workplace and to the families. Beer fridays are a common occurrence- families included.","As Rivian is still working through initial processes, questions arise on how decisions are made."
346,Rivian,Best Job Ever,2015-08-11,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"All of the hard work, energy, and talent of a giant company without any of the bureaucracy or office politics!

Rivian is still very much in startup mode, and there are still few employees. But the work environment is the best I've ever experienced. The place is stacked with talented people from the bottom to the top, and everyone encourages and helps each other to get the job done.

The corporate mission is inspiring and makes you want to come to work every day to help the company's vision become a reality (sorry... have to be vague due to disclosure issues).","As with any startup, not all of the systems or processes are fully developed, and that can sometimes slow things down. But if you get discouraged by that kind of thing, Rivian is not the place for you because we need people who can work through the challenges of setting up these things from scratch."
347,Rivian,Incomparable on every level!!!,2015-04-15,5.0,Design Team,"CEO RJ Scaringe, is one of the most charismatic, brilliant and focused leaders I have ever had the opportunity to work for; RJ has fostered and maintained a creative, fast acting culture that is second to none.  Rivian is a truly authentic, inspiring and empowered environment; from Janitor to CEO, all associates are valued and are relied upon for their personal insight.  Making history, instead of watching it go by.  Joining Rivian Automotive was a life changing event, the best decision I have ever made!",Wading through the sea of ordinary people and conventional ideas that are determined to see us fail.
348,Rivian,Awesome Place. Awesome People. Awesome Products.,2016-05-11,5.0,,"-I worked for a big corporation for 10 years prior to taking the leap to Rivian. The creativity and   desire to make awesome products at Rivian is unmatched. 
-Compensation is great.
-Co-workers are helpful and wanting to collaborate daily.
-I want to come to work to make a difference (couldn't say that about my previous job)
-Food is catered often (Food Trucks, Panera, Chipotle, etc.)
-Beer Thursday (Rivian Social: once a month)
-Family and friends are encouraged to come see what we are doing (with a signed NDA, of course)",The company is growing very fast and the onboarding process is long.
349,Rivian,No Work Life Balance,2019-06-01,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Most people are great to work with, intelligent and hard working.","Inexperienced management with poor leadership skills. Also, Rivian is so understaffed that the expectation is to work extra hours to make up for this with no overtime.  They have a huge staff turnover as they burn everyone out. To check this fact out, look online and see the high number of ex employees from this company in its very short life span. 

They have an unlimited PTO policy which means zero when everyone still works during their time off but that is to say if you are even able to take time off. 

Health benefits are okay, nothing special and 401k is below par. Life Insurance however is quite good but short and long term disability is quite low compared to other companies in this area that are at 80-100%. 

The office environment is extraordinary loud with elevator music playing all day and so many people speaking so loud, you end up with a headache at the end of the day. Many people in the office bring their own noise canceling headphones from home to wear all day to block out the noise."
350,Rivian,Dream Job,2013-11-24,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Everyone has a voice here, ease of access to all departments including the CEO.  Empowered team environment where creativity and culture are king, Rivian is a place where negativity and the classic OEM mentality aka the ""old guard,"" will fail.","Other than stating the obvious fact that long hours, undying determination and sacrifice are a given in a start up environment, I have no cons to offer."
351,Rivian,"Exciting, Engaging and Empowering.",2015-04-08,5.0,Development Engineer,"The team.
The fun work environment.
The creative, collaborative culture.
The fact that your voice is heard and your input actually makes its way into the design/program.

Because we are a start-up, it has been thrilling to watch the company grow from where we were 5 years ago to where we are today and it excites me to think where we will  be in 5 more years.","Because we are a small team, each person is held responsible for a large amount of their subsystem, which can be overwhelming if you are used to having a small role in a large company."
352,Rivian,Strategy review,2015-08-14,5.0,Corporate Strategy,"I grew up in Michigan and always said I'd never work for a automotive company. They seemed slow and bureaucratic, but this is very different. My position at Rivian is a dream job. I get to work with bright, hardworking people  - all aligned on building an incredible company.","If you want to build an incredible company in an industry experiencing rapid change, you have to be flexible.  We face ambiguity on a daily basis, and if you're not comfortable with ambiguity you won't enjoy Rivian."
