Get in young with R&M as CoOp or intern or right out of college.  They will send you all over the country on their dime and you can grow your career quickly.","If you didn't join the company young you sometimes feel left out of ""the good ole boys club"".  

When it comes time to settle down you might have to look for options outside the company.   

Younger salary employees need more trips home than 3 year.  That is just not right when R&M is a ""Family"" company.  A trip home a month can recharge an employee and keep them interested in working on the road.  

Sometimes slow to promote or not provide a plan for future of employees. 

Some lack of continuity between branch offices."

Everyone has gone above and beyond to ensure that I am set up for success. I would highly recommend applying should there be an opportunity.",I don't have any negative comments about Robins & Morton.
120,Robins & Morton,Amazing company,2020-03-09,5.0,Project Engineer,Great people to work for,Sometimes the travel is far from home
121,Robins & Morton,Definitely One of the Best,2016-10-22,5.0,Project Engineer,"This is great general contracting company, lots of work in Healthcare and growing in Commercial (Hotels, etc.). Very forward thinking company that truly does provide opportunities for personal and professional growth. I left another GC to come work with this company and I don't regret it one bit! These guys are top notch! They are really heading in the right direction. They are already experts at customer service and getting even better with recognizing that their success comes from those who get up every morning and represent them (their employees). At Robins & Morton, you will be recognized as an individual with a name and not just another number. Great Management really being proactive in obtaining more work and committed to providing opportunities to their employees. For a construction company, this company is truly exemplary in every sense. This company will give you an opportunity and it's up to you to seize the moment!So, glad to be working for Robins & Morton.","The only con is probably the same challenge that every construction company struggles with and that's work/life balance. But, they realize this and are looking for ways to improve this aspect; as much as possible."
122,Robins & Morton,Fantastic Company,2019-11-13,5.0,Project Engineer,"Family environment, great work/life balance. They listen to what you want in your future and help make that happen.",No cons that I can think of

125,Robins & Morton,Project Management,2017-07-18,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Progressive, yet grounded in core principles. Emphasis on safety, quality and continual improvement. Management cares about what employees have to say and contribute. It's not so much what they say as what they actually do which is refreshing. Leadership inspires respect, going the extra mile and doing the right thing both within and outside the organization - clients, designers, subcontractors, suppliers and other business affiliates. There is a definite willingness to place personnel where they can succeed and flourish. This can be in different roles, locations, departments, etc. A good blend of experienced builders and innovative newcomers to the industry. It's the real deal.","Though progressive in an overall sense, some lifetime employees (leaders) can have the mindset that the R&M way of 30 to 40 years is the only way and be slow to give consideration to change. Support can sometimes be lacking due to the ongoing struggle that every contractor has in controlling its overhead. Support departments (IT, Accounting) do not always perform with the same sense of urgency as the operations groups having to meet aggressive schedule demands."
126,Robins & Morton,Awesome Company,2019-03-21,5.0,Recruiter,"It is by far the best company i have ever worked, the company does have a strong family culture and when someone is in need they will do whatever it takes to help that employee or his/her family.  This is the kind of company that you will be talking to the CEO  in the hallway and he will not show any kind of rush or hurry to finish the conversation because he needs to do something else, he will take the time to listen to what you need to say. 

Another great thing about the company is that when we are in a meeting, there are no job tittles, everyone can talk their mind (I usually talk too much) but they listen.","Nothing bad to said, If you want to be in a company that the janitor is treated with the same respect as the CEO, this is the one."
127,Robins & Morton,"Great Company with a Great Culture, One of the Great Ones.",2019-03-22,5.0,VDC Manager,"I have been in the construction industry for over 20 years, Robins & Morton has by far been one of the best organizations I have worked for. The company is growing responsibly and most importantly they are not losing their values that make them a great business with that small company family feeling. If you work hard and are passionate about your job and supporting your co-workers the sky is the limit. This is the kind of company where you see yourself retiring from.",Can be a little slow to making change but change they do.  Overall the cons are so far and few between that it is extremely hard to even think of one.
128,Robins & Morton,One in a Million Employer,2019-03-21,5.0,Recruiting Assistant,"I work at the corporate office. Here there is wonderful work life balance and trust. R&M trusts its employees will come to work ready to give it their all and in return the work life balance, benefits, and compensation are reflected. The values and morals start from the top, everyone is treated as an equal. There is opportunity for growth and a plethora of development opportunities. Management really cares about the men and women on the job sites and will go above and beyond to make sure safety and fairness are a top priority.",Can't really think of any.
129,Robins & Morton,A company like no other,2016-09-08,5.0,Field Office Assistant,There are so many reasons to work for Robins & Morton.  From the upper management to the staff in the field.  Robins & Morton feels like family and that's by design.  I don't know of another company that takes care of their employees in a crisis or life situations like R&M does.  We have traveled with R&M for the last 12 years.  We wouldn't do this job if we didn't love it AND who we work for.  The best company by far!,"It's really hard to think of any cons.  It can be hard to travel so far away from family, but that's the nature of the business, nothing to do with the company."
130,Robins & Morton,Laborer/Carpenter's Helper,2016-03-07,3.0,Carpenter's Helper,Safety conscious company with weekly meetings for the whole job site and daily meetings for RM employees. They offer a 401K and health benefits.,"Lack of organization, management tries to pinch pennies and is hesitant to buy necessary tools and materials leaving employees to scavenge from the garbage. Megalomaniacal Chief Superintendent that orders employees to throw away equipment belonging to subcontractors if out of place. Mandatory 56 hour work weeks, frequent mandatory to come in on Sundays (64 hour work week). Little to no possibility of advancement. Managers talk down to employees and insult our intelligence. Management refused to provide parking for employees forcing us to park 1 mile from job site and pay out of pocket $240/mo. extremely slow to reimburse. No regard for family conaiderations such as employees' sons'  and daughters' graduations."
131,Robins & Morton,Great Place to Learn and be Part of a Team,2017-08-18,4.0,Project Engineer,I have been with R&M for 5 months and R&M is a great company that treats employees like family.  They care about employees and want them to learn and grow with the company.  Their Co-Op program is top notch and put student in control of work and expect them to get things done.  Young Field Engineers and Project Engineers are expected to contribute and be a driving force to the project.  Its great to see R&M put so much faith in their young employees.  Can't wait to see what the future holds.,My only con would be as a traveling PE is the trips home.  I have worked on the road before and have got a long weekend home a month.  R&M doesn't have these weekend set for PEs.

We diligently mentor and train our employees so that they’re progressing in their careers.,"We do not have the same name recognition as some of the bigger general contractors.  Therefore, we may get overlooked by good candidates.  We offer the benefits and opportunities of working for a big company while maintaining a small company feel."
133,Robins & Morton,A Shot Above the Rest,2017-06-29,5.0,Project Administrative Assistant,"Flex time, beautiful colocations, great people, building foward initiatives, strong team ethics, excellent benefits, support structure on and off the job, sharing knowledge, communications, technology, great people, travel & training opportunities galore, building people up with targeted growth, ...where do I start and where do I end?  Did I mention great people?","There is no con to having a good job surrounded by great people.

138,Robins & Morton,True to the Family Culture Cliché,2017-06-27,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"The culture is something I did not think existed at companies.

Work environment is amazing.  Everyone treats you with respect.  A feeling of inclusion and ""family"" is the general tone.  They are always looking for ways to move forward and upward.","If you are on the jobsites you tend to not have as much of the ""family"" sense,  but that can be avoided by putting forth small amounts of effort to spend time with coworkers outside of the work environment."
142,Robins & Morton,Great company that truly cares for its employees.,2019-03-13,5.0,Project Engineer,Upper management is approachable. They treat their employees like family and truly care about them. Compensation is fair. 2 weeks paid paternity leave. Strong belief in training and career advancement. They believe in promoting from within. Strong safety culture. Nice change of pace to fly to other job sites for training.,Work/Life balance not the best at times. Frequent relocation. Kinda high health insurance deductibles. No company match for 401k until after 2 years.
