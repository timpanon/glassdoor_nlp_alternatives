1,Roche,Great people - interesting products,2022-03-16,5.0,Manager User Experience,The culture is great. The people are super helpful and always willing to help out when needed. The mission is meaningful and everyone tries to live it. The products are very interesting to work on.,It's a big company which means that some changes take a while. The healthcare space requires a lot of documentation and overhead.
2,Roche,Good Company- Pay could use overhaul,2022-02-25,4.0,Field Engineer,"Great benefits, great people to work with. State of the art instruments that provide so much for patients.","Pay raises below standard, with inflation this year and record profits Roche made, raises across nation are very low and was really discouraging to field workers who have been holding this company up while most haven't left their house in two years. 

Field workers have had to work insane hours and install a ton of instruments so the pay raises to appreciate this would have been nice, given the billions made. We are short staffed greatly already so worried this is going to cause even more Field Engineers to leave now."
3,Roche,Like constant reorganization?    Like virtue signals?   You’ll love it,2022-02-12,2.0,IT Professional,"Good benefits and pay, and if you are lucky your manager will care. If not, don’t look for support from higher ups. They are utterly disengaged and usually ignore the reality of the every day. I NEVER hear from more than 1 layer up from my direct manager.","Leadership level managers only get information from middle managers who are often career motivated and hide the ugly underneath. 

Cross division (pharma vs diagnostics) communication is nonexistent, there is no alignment in processes or consideration of technical realities 

Woke - every time you turn around there is a new virtue signal….right down to the screensavers. No room for any political conservatism or populist thinking. 

They won’t fire incompetence, but they will fire people with personal conviction about bodily autonomy, then send gloating emails how they are firing those who dared resist. Lives and livelihoods lost. Then again maybe they were the lucky ones.

Preaches D&I the actively exclude on ideological basis. If you are hard left, you’ll fit right in. Don’t dare say you object to management denial of choice and bodily autonomy."

I believe it is a toxic department. I believe you will be subjected to bullying and fear. You probably will have a pit in your stomach every Sunday night and weekday morning. You probably will regret taking the job.

You will be forced to treat your operations “partners” unfairly. This will limit your career. They will not want to hire you, or transfer you in. You will probably be stuck in the toxic QA department forever.

Badly outdated compliance practices. I believe you will not learn current GMP, desired throughout industry. Not good for your career.

Employees have been jumping ship left, right and center over the last year, creating massive knowledge gaps throughout the organization that have generated a lot of chaos, reactive ways of working and the feeling that the house is on fire.

- Speaking of benefits, one major thing you can use those benefits for is to further your education if you so desire. They have a very generous tuition assistance program.
- Just about everyone here is genuinely friendly, and more than willing to help out your group with something should the need arise.","- Admittedly, the culture that this company loves to talk up is sometimes cringeworthy.
- Realistically, there is very little chance, particularly with the recent hiring surge followed by a hiring freeze, that you will be able to move up within the organization. This is usually the case with most companies anymore, but for a company that preaches the personal development of its employees, it is hypocritical.
- Management is not connected with the employees within the labs. They make decisions at times that are to the active detriment of such employees. I will say that normally management is fine, but they have made some decisions that have left me scratching my head to an extent."

In my experience they have become more bottom line driven, evidenced by layoffs after a phenomenal growth year. I know many top tier employees that were let go, with no effort by Roche to retain them. These layoffs also left many key customers without ideal support.

Overall the work is stimulating.,Only applicable for the diagnostics side but the company is really slow when it comes to considering or adopting new technology. Most if not all diagnostic R&D assays utilize PCR as the reporter which makes sense since it is Roche's bread and butter.

Work life balance and benefits are pretty good.  Compensation is average.  Facilities are managed quite well.  Free snacks are available though that may change once the new cafeteria is ready.,"By far the biggest drawback is the toxic work culture and weak management.  There are a number of managers who do not have their employees' back, leaving them to fend for themselves until they either become toxic themselves as a survival mechanism, or leave the company in time so that self-healing can begin.

Politics is par for the course - yet it is the intensity level that takes it to a whole new dimension.  Power grabs, empire building, scapegoating, and undermining other teams are openly on display without appropriate action (and sometimes not even a reaction) from local management.  The one transgression not on display, by virtue of its definition, is backstabbing (which also happens quite often). 

There are some that complain about too many processes.  This is not a start-up anymore.  There is a lack of the right kind of processes that can propel an organization to efficiently reach its business goals.  Removing the brakes so that one team can work faster without fully appreciating the impacts on other teams results in a longer time to reach the organization's business objectives.

The Molecular Solutions cultural values plastered on the walls are mostly viewed as wall art as local management often do not practice via leading by example."

The leadership wants as few people in SSF as possible, and the remaining positions are high paying, but come with high expectations.
