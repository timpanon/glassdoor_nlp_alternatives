Very top heavy, more managers, product owners, scrum masters, and delivery leads, than actual workers. The workers then need to be in constant alignment meetings with all the unnecessary overhead people when there might be just one or two people doing real work.

Every job posting says ""great vacations start with great employees"", it won't be your vacation though, you get 2 weeks and very few Holidays per year, one Holiday for the whole month of December. You are expected to spend your vacation on cruises to learn the business, and if you do that and get bumped off the cruise last minute you might have wasted the few days of vacation you have staying home."

Stand by cruises for employees! In my experience, most of my co-workers were very nice, hard-working people.","The thing to remember when seeking employment there is that you will be tethered to a phone in front of a computer taking call after call all day long and are expected to adhere strictly to your schedule.  Believe it or not, every minute is measured and affects your ranking.  The lowest ranking employees get the worst schedules, such as working closing shifts and weekends. You will hear about it if you are not in compliance even by a minute! You can be fired for being out of compliance too often. So you literally have to walk around with a timer on you.  I worked there 13 years and for most of that time, supervisors often did not know how to do their jobs effectively or even how to motivate their team without being negative or threatening.  Most of them had been away from being on the phone for so long they could not remember the pressures or demands of the job, so could not adequately lead or even assist their team members.  It wasn't until recently that management started to retrain and evaluate supervisors to make them more effective."

If a manager doesn't like you for personal reasons, you are gone. There are no second chances to anything. I can see expecting the best from an employee, but if there are complex issues that are affecting the employee there is no one to help out and no time given to work it out. Some long time managers are believed over the employee without the employee being asked why their performance was lacking. It's a last in, first out mentality."

They smile to your face,  pretend to know policies,  will tell you one thing,  then later deny it.  They set unachievable goals for handle time,  and hold time.  When you have to call resolutions,  you can be on hold for 20-30 minutes.  This is completely out of your control,  but yet... Watch that handle time!   When you have disasters like.. Canceled sailings and disrupted sailings,  you can expect back to back calls from rightfully angry guest.  Then they get to complete a survey on the service you provided... Not good when their sailing gets canceled one week in advance.  Like most call centers,  they have no heart.  Better not need to call out due to a family emergency!!!  I have won top team member twice, but never got the luncheon I was promised.  So much fake... Employee appreciation."
461,Royal Caribbean Group,"Nice perks, very corporate, not too creative",2015-06-23,3.0,,"The cruise line is amazing and for a writer, its easy to sell. Because RC is connected to so many exciting brands (Coca Cola, Barbie, Dreamworks, etc) you get to work on all of them. If you enjoy telling your friends about vacations and exotic destinations, you'll love writing for this company.  Cool location at the port of Miami.","If you're looking to be creative, this is not the place.  Like many corporate shops,  it's run like a factory. If Creative had a fast food window, this would be it. It's a retail shop and maybe that's what works for this type of industry. Think super market circulars and ads that promote daily deli discounts and you'll be fine. Not much time to concept or dream up the next big idea. Write mediocre copy real fast and you'll make an impression. In the end,  I felt that RC wasn't really interested in copy that set them apart from the other cruise lines. Perhaps they don't need to. They have a premium product, state-of-the-art hardware and a loyal customer base. And no one will be launching a cruise line to compete with them anytime soon. But GM could teach them a few lessons."
462,Royal Caribbean Group,Senior Assistant Beverage Manager,2017-07-24,4.0,Senior Assistant Beverage Manager,"See the world. Make friends from all over the world.  Management perks.  Single cabin. Epic crew parties.  A challenging position that allows you to be creative and improve your management skills.  Plenty of room for advancement.  This can be some of the most rewarding work of your life but you have to make it that way.  You have to earn your place on the ship with your fellow crew.  New hires in any position on the ship are not given trust nor respect, they must earn it.  And that takes time.","You work 10 hours minimum every single day of your contract (contract starts at 4 months for this position but you can be extended).  Expect to work 12-16 hours on the first and last day of the cruise.  The job can be extremely stressful.  It's very easy to get fired from this job.  Constantly under pressure to achieve revenue, guest satisfaction ratings, and ship sanitation standards.  New hires are not always treated kindly.   There can be a lot of anti-American sentiment from your fellow crew members that you have to deal with on a constant basis."
463,Royal Caribbean Group,As a LAST resort work here!,2015-01-21,1.0,Sales Support,Free gym to use in building and NO ONE is EVER in it!  They ONLY promote from within which you have to know all aspects of the job before you can be promoted so don't be fooled that hiring outside for management positions is even a possibility!,"Highly underpaid and upper managements goal is to figure out ways to pay you less and less.  Due to state agreements (they pay NO taxes) they are unable to lay off employees yet they are also required to hire ""X"" amount of new employees every year.  To accommodate this agreement they do MASS firings.  From April to October it is VERY normal for 150-200 employees to have been fired EVERY year to which they then hire on the average 250 new employees between October and December.  January through May they hire handfuls of people off and on.  The state only cares about their ""new hires"" the local media ONLY hears about them constantly hiring and ONLY their ex and current employees likewise the department of employment know how they really work!  They have one of the highest unemployment claims in the state!  This company is currently being sued for millions on top of millions of dollars for ilegal work practices, inadiquately paying their shipboard employees and ilegal work conditions.  To the untrained ear this company sounds great to work for but you soon find out differently!  In a pinch work there IF you need a job but keep your resume out there and keep interviewing!  Longevity with this company is rare to nonexistent!"
464,Royal Caribbean Group,Benefits are great... but the culture and treatment of employees leaves a lot of room for development.,2016-05-01,3.0,Star,"Great benefits packages, great base pay, some schedules in some departments are great.  There is lots of promotion potential to an extent, but you will hit a glass ceiling.","Chaotic, poorly managed.  The supervisors are not the best bunch that the company has to offer, but it's often people who suck up that get promoted into higher positions, not the ones who do the best job or are deserving.  The attendance policy is very strict.  They do whatever they can in order to avoid paying out incentive.  They have very high expectations for some employees and low expectation for others and the cultures in different offices creates a lot of friction.  People feel that one call center has less expectation that others and the training is very poor.  The company seems to be pushing hard to outsource or move offshore to the Philippines and Guatemala, which creates a lot of stress on employees who wonder if they'll be laid off.  Employees have 0 impact on decision and technology is lacking greatly, but the company has no intention to help it's employees do their jobs efficiently to meet their expectations.  Richard Fain wants his company to be a Fortune 500, but they're ignoring the basics."

467,Royal Caribbean Group,"Overall, an OK place to work, if you like cruises",2008-06-12,4.0,Manager,"If you cruising, this is the place, though seniority takes precedent when assigning cabins and of course, employees get the ""not so great cabins"" -read inside cabins.
Very caring and ""real"" VP of HR - she truly cares for people and their well being, however, her hands are tied when it comes to approving higher salary increases.  
People seem to like to work here.  Employees stay for a very long time - 15, 20 years.
Level of satisfaction depends on the Department you are working for.  Some are better than other, though I would say to anyone, stay away from Supply Chain (Purchasing)","Very political!!  Some extremely rude and poor managers in top positions and company does nothing to correct their poor behavior or lack of people and management skills.  There seem to be too many chiefs and it takes too long to make decisions. Salaries, from managers down, are very poor at best and raises even poorer!  Salaries and raises do not stay at par with cost of living.  This year's increase for 2007 was a mere 3%.  Offices are at the Port of Miami and unless you live downtown or in the immediate surrounding areas, the commute is hellish due to traffic and street congestion"
468,Royal Caribbean Group,Cruise Representative,2017-09-26,1.0,Cruise Specialist,"They have a really nice facility, nice and open. Once you realize what you've gotten into, it turns out to be extremely deceptive.","They put a beautiful gloss on what essentially is a standard row of cubicles where you are not a human. You are not a living breathing person, but only a statistic generator and a revenue generator.

Management is completely oblivious and do ""employee engagement"" things that are more appropriate for 2nd graders than grown adults. One example of these is that every day that you meet statistical goals (which is possible, but 100% based on the luck of the draw on your calls) you get a ticket. Collect enough tickets and you can exchange for silly little toys like slinkys or small snacks. If this company used child labor, this would be appropriate.

Management and promotions are EXTREMELY favoritism based. You could have stellar stats and revenue generation numbers, perfect attendance, but if a single member of management doesn't care for you (even if you've never really met them) you are out of luck for any promotion. May as well not even bother trying.

Yes, you get a free cruise after a year there, but to be honest, its not worth it. Would you give up one year of your life for a cruise worth (at most) a thousand dollars? Find a job you love and just buy a cruise."
469,Royal Caribbean Group,Decent Place to Work,2016-07-05,4.0,Club Royale Agent,"Management is working with the Employee Engagement Committee consistently to continue improving employee satisfaction and retention. The pay for ""promoted roles"" in the Springfield, OR call center is good - so good that trying to find an administrative assistant position in the area at the same pay is nearly impossible.","Attendance issues are usually pretty inflexible. The call center works on rotating shifts, with 4-month shift bids based on ""metrics"" that are only partially in the control of the employee. ""Compliance"" (adherence to a schedule picked for you) is a big factor in shift bids, but getting stuck on a call that takes you into/over your breaks or lunches is not mitigated at all, making that really unfair. QA scores of your calls are random - seems like the ones you know you ""nailed"" are rarely chosen to be QA'd. Working in a call center is challenging because the rotating shifts make it very difficult to make strong working relationships, which can sometimes make or break an employee's morale. Dealing with sometimes elitist and entitled guests who think their loyalty status allows them to treat you like an idiot is unfortunate, and there's nothing you can do about it."
