0,Slalom,Honored to work here,2021-07-27,5.0,N/A,"- My voice is heard
- I feel I have the autonomy and flexibility to do my job well
- The leaders and team members genuinely care for one another and our clients

Slalom DC has set the bar for all other companies. I feel lucky to work here with amazing people, good work, and the time they invest to always be better than they were yesterday.","- You have to set boundaries with your time. If you can do that, then it can be a great experience here."
1,Slalom,Great company to work for,2022-03-30,5.0,Consultant,"- Benefits are fantastic
- Management is understanding of all your needs
- Deadlines are reasonable","- Clients can be unpredictable
- Steep learning curve"
2,Slalom,"Amazing colleagues,  fun work culture, great for early career.",2022-02-16,5.0,Associate Consultant,"- You will be surrounded by hard-working, genuine, (and many hilarious) people
- Quality leaders in D&A practice. Generally take action if you voice your opinion or have issues with your projects
- Great place for early career consultants to learn/grow in IT space
- Flexible working hours and work life balance
- Overall competitive pay and opportunity to work with latest/greatest tech with few barriers to entry. They hired me with very little practical software engineering experience.
- Associate consultant ""BootCamp"" was fun to meet other colleagues from across the country.","- Very project-dependent. Some clients are, let's say.. unkind.. some are very nice 
- Hard to specialize or work on just a few technologies/ types of projects. I felt my role was designed to be more of a generalist consulting role - which could be amazing for some people's career goals. You might have one super technical project then one non-technical project as an associate. 
- Growing rapidly and becoming a bigger consulting firm that competes with Accenture, Deloitte, BCG, etc. I noticed a culture shift and more bureaucracy over time.

Ultimately, I did not find IT consulting that interesting and wanted to pursue other passions. But if you want a career in tech consulting, can't think of a better place to start (speaking from an early-career perspective)"
3,Slalom,Mixed feelings,2022-04-03,3.0,Consultant,Culture. Allow for creativity. Many projects are approached with a experience design mindset.,"- Pay is not competitive 
- Many inexperienced people with high titles
- Not allowed to travel internationally with work computer - it means you must take PTO or unpaid time off
-The global and local team dynamic is challenging at times
- The system for growth does not take into account different paths; time requirements"
4,Slalom,Not the same anymore at all,2022-03-01,2.0,Consultant,- The people are great (for the most part),"- a lot of people in leadership positions who shouldn’t be… nepotism left and right 
- talks the talk about diversity but doesn’t walk the walk
- the culture is always their excuse for underpaying people… being remote now, nothing outweighs the low pay 
- pestering employees to leave good reviews or share content so the company can be seen as a top company… not a good look.
- company has become too big over the last 5 years. It’s not the same at all. On the path to being the next Accenture… what a shame."

7,Slalom,Slalom's Culture Strikes the Perfect Balance,2022-02-08,5.0,Senior Director,"Great work-life balance- you won't get that at a lot of consulting firms.
Company cares about doing good for the local markets and global issues- Spends millions on global challenges and the employees are behind this as well.
Growth mindset- Slalom has sustainable growth because employees love the company and leadership cares about it's people.
Attracts top talent in almost all markets.","Of course, everyone would like to make more salary, but that usually comes at a cost...

19,Slalom,Culture? Didnt exist,2022-01-25,2.0,Associate,"Work/life balance, co-workers are actually decent people, the office was inviting and hip but thanks to Covid, that wont exist anymore.","Woke, the culture was non-existent, no training provided for new employees, people without a consulting background looked down upon and harder to get promoted, lack of transparency around promotion path and when it would actually take place, basically everyone in leadership started their career at Accenture, minimal time off, minimal bonus if at all"
20,Slalom,Achieving Greatness and Work/Life Balance,2022-01-16,5.0,Analytics Consultant,"Career opportunities, work/life balance, great pay, great company values, and truly intelligent people. There are so many things to love about working here, and I have grown to become a bigger advocate for Slalom over time. Slalom has been the longest employer that I’ve been at in the past 10 years since graduating from college, and I’ve been fortunate enough to have worked for other tech and industry companies prior. I am trying really hard to keep this review short, and to give other’s a glimpse of what Slalom is about. I plan on staying with Slalom for many more years to come, there’s so many learning opportunities, from earning new technology certificates, to new coding languages, or consulting skills, to leading internal initiatives, or helping great companies accomplish even greater things - this is the career benefit. For work/life balance - I am new mother, just returned from maternity, and I get to spend every morning and evening with my kids; I rarely work over time. Now for the people you’ll work with (colleagues) - everyone is super intelligent, humble, and will do their best to support you always. It’s about making connections and being authentic; as long as you are you, and are a team player, you will do well at this consulting firm. Now for Slalom - Slalom’s leaders mean well, they reflect often and do their best to show appreciate to their employees and awareness to changing times. I respect all of them, especially our ID&E leader. Slalom is an incredible company to work for and to be a part of. Good luck!","Maybe more PTO time, but they just increased our floating holidays and bumped up our 401k match, and give solid raises every year, even through 2020 COVID-19 and had no layoffs. They have their priorities straight, which is always putting their people first!"

23,Slalom,Smart People - Fun Place - Low respect for Business Development,2022-03-04,3.0,Business Development Executive,Smart People - Fun Environment. The company generally does good work.,Comp plans has some very subjective components. They can find ways to delay paying you or paying you at all. They pay a bit less than other firms.

The supportive culture, which is highlighted as a differentiator in interviews is non existent. Leaders are trying to deal with scale of the business, but are unwilling to prioritize the activities that will get them there. In my time, I've heard the organization compared to a kindergarten. Folks at the manager level and down are hard working, but the politics and manipulation taking place at leadership levels was more than a surprise.

- Have to scratch and claw to get a promotion and even then, relationships with Directors is a must have, otherwise your work will never get recognized on merit alone
- Compensation is way, WAY below industry standards. Known to counter-offer with higher salaries only as employees are on their way out the door.
- Don't come here trying to do business consulting. Was always and continues to become mainly an IT consulting firm. The fit for former Big 4 consultant is becoming less logical than it was 3-4 years ago."

70,Slalom,"Questionable Management, Discrimination",2022-01-20,1.0,Solution Principal,Can rack up lots of air miles.,"Early in my time at Slalom, I referred an Indian women to work on my team- she had with relevant skills and experience and impressive academic credentials. He refused to give her so much as a tech screen and then proceeded to hire a man with no relevant education/experience outside of a bootcamp, when I asked why, he referenced referred candidates race/gender and implied I was argumentative because I'm Jewish. This ended up going to HR and was the start of several years of retaliation.

I was kept on the bench longer than my male peers, though I was an experienced hire, and put in situations where I said manager hoped I'd fail so that he could justify keeping me on the bench. After passing a difficult client interview and finally making it off the bench, I was heavily monitored/babysat compared to my male peers. My female direct report was also kept on the bench longer, given lower titles/pay despite my attempts to advocate for my team.

The petty retaliation impacted my mental health: I had a ridiculously high rate of travel compared to others, department lead would do things like organize department the off-site (about 12 people) for when I was already on vacation... I could go on. I asked HR for an ADA accommodation and they refused to negotiate accomodations. I have a history of anxiety and offered documentation. There was definitely a shift from petty retaliation to actively trying to fire me after ADA request, and I ultimately had so many panic attacks I took FMLA and left.

I would have left much sooner except this was the tough part of the pandemic and I didn't feel like I had a choice. Many higher level leaders were aware- please don't believe their PR hype about DEI.

Leadership, especially in the ML space is incompetent. They were often so desperate to sell anything that they would make crazy promises and drastically under estimate work. This often meant long hours for consultants to pick up the pieces or lots of travel."

I was never a day-to-day consultant so I cannot speak to the working conditions but the rumor has it Slalom underpays for the market (probably, we need to make a profit) and some engagements wind up being more staff aug than people expect."

no layoffs during covid. 
no travel unless you want to","If you are not in technology - there are very few opportunities to do great work. Strategy practices are still selling mostly PM work. No clear direction or strategy from Seattle leadership to leverage advisory work. The salespeople, or the leaders within various offices, don't understand how to sell strategy work. They are not willing to invest in the right type of strategy leaders. They need to understand that advisory work brings in more technology work – it is all connected. If you are a strategy or a finance professional – best to look elsewhere. Maybe Slalom will get their act right when it comes to selling strategic work but I don’t see it happening. Not many growth opportunities for non-technology folks. 
The new career framework was not rolled out properly. They wanted to standardize roles and titles but did a poor job of it. They did not consider people's experiences. Giving someone with 20 years of experience the same title as another consultant with 5 years of experience is not the right way to do it. They purposely held back people and didn’t give them the deserving titles because Slalom did not want to increase their pay. Now, everyone is trying to get promoted to a position they should have already gotten and or looking to move out of Slalom. 
Pay is lower than the competitors."

94,Slalom,Beware - Unorganized business  ops,2022-01-05,1.0,Operations Analyst,Good company overall. Business ops is a nightmare. Wouldn’t recommend.,"The company as a whole is good. However, working on the business ops side is a nightmare. Some markets only have 1 business ops person to support 100+ leaders. When concerns are mentioned to management they say this is how it’s always been. Many duties for this role are unconventional. Ranging from tasks that are HR related, training leaders, forecasting for consultants bonuses, tech support, admin related work leaders don’t want to do and anything new that might come up that they want you to help with.. all while not having a plan to increase the team. There is no documentation for anything at a company wide level. They encourage each market to have flexibility. This leads to repeat questions from leaders and dependency. In some markets the manager you report to may not be in business operations. This means they don’t fully understand your role, value your time or what you do. Business ops employees get a ton of work dumped on them to “own” with little to no guidance on how to complete said tasks all while being the sole “champion” for the entire market and being responsible for training 100+ leaders on said procedures. There’s a huge lack of black employees. I think maybe 2% of the company is black and some markets have zero black leaders. Too many on camera back to back meetings for things that could be said in an email."

A lot of my coworkers are leaving due to the new executives and changes that haven taken place. In my opinion, the executive changes has made Slalom has lose its charm. It's becoming more focused on the numbers than the relationships and people focus that they previously had. When I left Slalom, I didn't feel cared for by senior leadership like I previously did. The close family vibe changed to more of a corporate vibe where I seemed more like a worker/number than a person. It's just not what it used to be and many long time employees are leaving because it. 

Also, they don't do anything to help with seniority and compensation. They aren't willing to pay fair market rates accordingly even if you have worked at the company 5+ years, and therefore they're losing on great talent who care about the company and perform well. Then they end up paying higher amounts for new employees coming in since they obviously can't get them at the cheap rates they were paying previously."

I was almost always asked to making large comprises to fill placements needed on projects that were either not my preferred subject-matter or role, and almost always later promised that the ""next project"" would be something closer to my professional goals. I felt that Slalom never cultivated my strongest skills, because the projects sold didn't match my goals. It was a mismatch of company and employee, but the sad thing is Slalom kept telling me the next opportunity would be something ""I"" wanted.

- They hired a new Chief HR Officer and all of a sudden, the health benefits went down the toilet. Especially if you have a family.
- New career framework/titles are no good. Some people are average at best but rubbed elbows with the higher ups and received an inflated title. This really upset the high performers who didn't get the title they were looking for.
- Some clients truly suck. I've worked at a number of consulting firms and for some reason the majority of clients we signed were truly horrible people to work with.
- Too many people hired without a consulting background. This means the trained consultants would need to pick up the slack. I personally worked with someone that had many years of industry experience so they had an inflated title but when it came down to consulting skills, they were horrible and I felt like I was training an 8 year old."

I don’t know why people are complaining, we are in tech we are all paid well and have great benefits. Slalom didn’t fire anyone due to the pandemic and did not rescind any offers. Financially, the organization is stable, successful, and growing.

Work life balance:
I know that it depends from project to project and some people do work crazy hours, but many of us stuck to the usual 40. I also know some people who had periods of nothing to do and would log on but do other things. I never had to work weekends and rarely worked over time.

Some people are genuinely supportive:
I met wonderful people who supported my career growth and offered a sense of community during the pandemic.","Diversity, equity and inclusion:
Slalom tries to convince us that the organization is already doing well in these areas. Unfortunately, the outright and subversive acts of racism, sexism, transphobia, and homophobia I’ve experienced and witnessed exceed what can be summarized here.

Promotions:
The reality at Slalom: you are more likely to get promoted if you are a white man, the numbers don’t lie. Slalom’s promotion process is simple: all you have to do is ask. Who has the confidence to ask for a promotion?

Lack of action:
Leaving Slalom was a last resort. I raised concerns with my managers, leaders in the department of diversity, equity and inclusion, and HR, and was met with inaction. In multiple cases, I faced gaslighting, meaning they denied the problem, and defended their choices.

People are leaving:
Slalom is growing because they’re hiring faster than people are quitting, for now. A lot of people are quitting, especially women and people of color. Not a great environment."

Slalom has been a breath of fresh air - from a work life balance standpoint, but also in terms of how colleagues treat each other. 
At Slalom I feel valued as a human being. Im encouraged to pursue hobbies and interests outside of work, and colleagues are invested in my success in all facets of life.

167,Slalom,Amazing People First Company,2021-06-10,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Amazing company to work for. They truly live by their core values. They really do care about their employees well being, make every possible effort so that you love what you do and this becomes the last company you work for (you never leave). Astounding people first work culture & people are the true asset of this company and Slalom understands and honors that. I have already referred Slalom to several of my friends.
The company is growing, and growing fast giving you the opportunity to grow with it.",Not one that I can think of as of now.
168,Slalom,Amazing onboarding experience,2021-09-09,5.0,Senior Consultant,"The culture is amazing, the people are so supportive and friendly, the remuneration is above average.","The culture might not suit everyone. There is a strong ""we are a family"" sentiment that may not appeal to all."
169,Slalom,Oh Slalom..,2021-11-01,1.0,Consultant,I never felt pressured to work crazy hours. The team was really good about normal work days.,"Uninspiring salaries, work was very boring and not challenging at all. I felt totally underutilized during my time there. Slalom Denver talks a big talk about innovation blah blah, but was terrified to dip their toes into opportunities outside of their comfort zone. Buyer beware, each market is different."
170,Slalom,"Good intentions and they care about their employees, mediocre work opportunities and low pay",2021-09-01,3.0,Software Consultant,"Benefits (they truly care about their employees and listen to feedback)
Pretty good PTO though its accrued
Good people (I imagine the culture is great, just havent had much experience because of covid)","Poorly matched ""alignments"" (client projects), you are often thrown into unfamiliar tech stacks and expected to figure it out. This pattern reflects poorly on Slalom because the client sees this inadequacy first-hand.

Disorganized process to staff you on a project, unclear steps and very ad-hoc.

Much of the work is staff augmentation at large companies. Rarely do you get a green field project with mostly Slalom members (which is what Slalom claims is their bread and butter)

Low pay. Slalom boasts about year over year growth and is a very successful company, but notoriously under pays people. They try to make up for it with ""mental health stipends"" (~$700 pre-tax) but ultimately that doesn't come close to a significant raise of 5% or more when most developers make six figures.

Growth internally feels very political. To get ahead you must work extra hours off the clock and play political games to win favor. Its not simply ""do your job well, show growth in responsibility and you'll be promoted"".

Hiring practices since the BLM movement started (June of 2020) are a bit awkward. There's a vague ""goal"" to have office demographics match the locale (racially), which ultimately results in preferential hiring.

Culture at Slalom is good, but sometimes feels like a cult. People are overly enthusiastic and rarely speak ill of the company.  Imagine a classroom where everyone is the type of person to raise their hand and be the teacher's pet (Hermione). Its get old when work != life for some of us."
171,Slalom,Core Values & Professional Development,2021-11-15,4.0,Principal Consultant,Strong investment in professional development. Robust set of core values.,Weak brand equity relative to other global consulting firms.
172,Slalom,Extremely Supportive,2021-07-06,5.0,Consultant,"I was making a major career change when I moved to Slalom, and I have received support from throughout my office for skill building, networking, and discovering career paths.

They also did not let people go during the pandemic because of work slowdowns, very helpful for those of us on the bench for long periods of time.","Profit sharing would be nice, especially given how well the company is doing. But they fully funded the bonus pool in 2020, so this is a minor complaint."

174,Slalom,"The more things change, the more they stay the same",2021-08-06,3.0,Consultant,"Company culture is genuinely special. People are aware of what's going on in the world and try to create a space where everyone is valued & accepted for the person they are. Leaders are accessible (in concept) and generally people are friendly. 

A lot of the cultural aspect of the job changed when we went remote because of covid, but at least in our market, the office ops team put in a huge amount of effort to maintain as much of the community feel as they could remotely.","A lot of politics. Internal politics matter more to career progression than they should. There are times when internal politics have negatively impacted client delivery, and this wasn't an isolated situation. 

Additionally, a new career framework was rolled out last year and despite promises that it would standardize criteria for promotion, it only added more politics and subjectivity into the mix. 

Managers are promoted when they don't have the actual skills to be good managers (provide consistent feedback, remember details about conversations with their people, advocate for their direct reports when appropriate).

Most of the roles at the consultant level are staff aug roles. You have to fight to be staffed in roles that actually align with your career interests...and there aren't that many to go around because of the type of work that is sold. NB: this is practice-dependent, but was the case for my practice.

Slalom pays a lot of lip service to diversity and inclusion, but the reality is there are very few non-white, non-male senior leaders across the company - and especially in my market.

Compensation for non-technical roles lags behind some other consulting firms and definitely lags behind equivalent industry jobs. Benefits are average at best and 401k matching is comparatively pretty low."

176,Slalom,"Overall company is good but, depends which group or people you work with.",2021-04-21,3.0,Software Engineer,"Good benefits, Nice work culture. But unpredictable team or managers.",Very silo working model. I was with them for 1.5 years. I know my friends working there planning to leave ( not currently happy ). Some are stuck till they find better opportunity. The consulting model is very competitive. Not that many projects. So you will be on higher level pushed to take what comes or else will sit on bench for a while. When you are on bench then really lot of pressure to do pass certification or do any projects which do not interest you.
177,Slalom,Go Elsewhere (Bad Leadership and Below-Market Pay),2021-09-15,1.0,Principal,"Smart and nice colleagues and very large, interesting client base. Plus, the name is good enough if you want to go to another consulting firm or into industry. Some semblance of work / life balance.","1. The ""project work"" is mostly staff augmentation like business requirements and PMO and mostly IC roles; very little traditional team-based consulting work. A lot of consultants have asked for more strategic work and management does seem not care - they just need to meet their absurd quotas and will ""sell"" bodies. Slalom is essentially a body shop. 
2. The management does not give one hoot about their people. They claim to care about careers, growth, diversity, etc. - but ALL they care about is utilization. Period. They treat the office as a body shop.
3. Sole focus on utilization. You can sell above your quota, but if you are not utilized at their absurdly high levels then they will put you on some sort of an improvement plan. They do not care about building out internal collateral to help sell or anything else; just utilization.
4. Fake Performance Improvement Plans. There were rumors of folks getting placed on bogus ""PIPs"" as an excuse of throwing them out to beef up utilization and profit numbers. This has happened in multiple markets across the firm.
5. Terrible management. Leadership across the markets across terrible. They would not be allowed in industry but, because they are able to sell tons of work, that is all the company cares about and so, they will continue to go unpunished.
6. Below-market pay. It is amazing how little they pay and if you ask for more, they will push back severely and if you leave for monetary reasons, they will insult you.
7. Leadership only cares about their stock price going up and will do whatever they can to preserve it (like low analyst wages)
8. Lack of diversity at the top of Slalom and the SF office. Also, curious how many other GMs at Slalom in the US are ethnic minorities? Also, why do you not give MLK and Juneteenth off? Is it because you don't want to lose the revenue from utilization that would have been gained on those 2 days?
9. Lack of career advancement. Promotions are pretty much based upon who the senior leadership happens to like and those people are accorded preferential treatment. If you are not one of the ""chosen ones,"" good luck!
10. They waste so much money on the pep rallies. They call these quarterlies (pep rallies) ""culture"" and say that is a benefit. I felt like I was back in my Midwestern High School waiting for Friday Night Lights to occur!

I am sure with this response, I will get some generic response from management asking me to contact them. Why? This is a firm that lies through its teeth. My advice: go to a Big 4, get some real consulting experience (and not BS staff augmentation work) and make some lifelong contacts. With those firms, you know what you are signing up for. At Slalom, you are told one thing and get another. The CEO says he wants to create ""a different type of firm?"" That is an absolute lie! Good riddance!"

If I had to call into work sick, I was made to feel guilty and ask how sick I was. I saw another review on here that seemed similar to my own experience when I shared with my manager and HR that I suffered with depression and anxiety and how not only was it getting severely worse as a result of my job, but it had also been impacting it. The response I received was blank stares, simply asking how can we help even though they really would not be able to actually support you, and hearing ""well that's the job."" If you are looking for a true work-life balance and an organization that ACTUALLY will support you and your mental health, look elsewhere.

2. Great events to socialize and mingle, albeit the format is always completely catering to the extrovert
3. The office is warm and inviting
4. Most people (non-management) are great to work with","I post this specifically related to the LA office, my understanding is that the culture can be different in each Slalom office. 

1. ""Consulting"" opportunities are few and far between. If you are not in a purely technical discipline, good luck getting staffed according to your skillsets, let alone desires. 
2. Management on projects kowtows to clients, no backbone whatsoever when it comes to SOW conflicts, scope creep, etc. I've had management throw me under the bus first, instead of standing up to the client.
3. You will mostly be on projects by yourself, and left to yourself, management doesn't see or really ask about your work, just as long as you are staffed and paid for by the client. 
4. You can't say no to a project, or you're toast. Even if the project work is completely out of your wheelhouse. You are asked to ""tweak"" your resume so they force-fit you into a role. 
5. If the wrong person in management doesn't ""like"" you, you're toast. They all share subjective ""feedback"" with each other about you behind your back. I was told by a previous manager that your relationships are actually more important than the work you do. To some extent that is true in consulting, but at Slalom LA it is taken to an extreme level. 
6. If you're not extremely extroverted you fade into the woodwork, no matter how hard you work or how good you are at what you do. 
7. Lastly, the LA commutes are brutal, but management will never negotiate WFH with a client, even on Fridays. They would rather put you through a 2 hour commute each way everyday than negotiate any kind of WLB with the client for you. All in the name of ""customer love"". Which morphed into ""customer obsession"" during my time there. Face palm."

- great potential
- private company","- leadership is ill equipped to lead with inspiration. saying things like ""world domination"" is immature, vague, and not inspiring. pandemic management was handled pretty well but I felt it was far too sensitive and not based in reality. i'm not interested in seeing leaders cry or conjure up some perception of sympathy on a monthly or quarterly basis. I would have preferred to understand the harsh realities of the situation for our business and have leadership rally everyone as a cohesive unit and team to confront our challenges.
- lack of focus; spray and pray approach to BD with 300+ partners. Slalom is trying to be all things to all people without building truly deep and lasting relationships that endure
- every office/market is in essence it's own entity so there is zero continuity of focus and messaging across markets. this is masked as ""entrepreneurship"" but it's really just a lack of proper management and leadership
- middle management can be extraordinarily poor leading to churn of really good people. most thought provoking, challenger, type leaders that joined Slalom while I was there only last 18-24 months. some who lasted longer began looking for a new job after the initial two years.
- churn of really good people occurs because middle managers feel threatened and tend not to listen to new and fresh perspectives. leaders feel like they have to have the answer so new thought can be quickly squashed by incompetent leadership
- there is no sales organization in this company; zero sales culture; it's a go get a meeting and get out of the way approach. funny though, leadership wonders why they can't negotiate better deals, longer term projects, and higher rates with operational/delivery focused people leading the negotiations.....hummmmm"

233,Slalom,Never Been More Proud,2021-04-27,5.0,Anonymous Employee,4 years here at Slalom and I can honestly say I have never been more proud to be part of such an incredible place. There have been incredible opportunities for growth and development both personally and professionally. I have always been amazed by supportive leaders and driven by the exciting work we do. Excited to see what the next 4 have in store!,I don't have any to share.
234,Slalom,"Good Culture, Lackluster everything else",2021-05-20,2.0,Consultant,They hire some of the best and smartest people to work in non-leadership roles. Core values are meaningful and events are fun (pre-covid). Work/life balance is better than big 4 and you don't have to travel.,"Slalom started off as a great place and is shiny looking when you interview and the first couple of months in, especially if you started before covid, but once you've been around for a few months you start seeing cracks in this organization and its empty promises. If you are an ambitious, hard working professional trying to grow in your prime years, this is the place your career will go to slow down or die unless you are one of the lucky few to have a people manager who actually cares about your growth over their own, even with their new career growth framework, which is terrible. Most projects are staff aug and if you don't sell work, you will not have any upward momentum no matter how well you perform in client delivery. The leadership team loves to call themselves ""leadership"" constantly, but don't act like it and the turn over of both leadership and consultants during my time there was over 50% in most practices. While the pay is pretty solid, the bonuses are really small for the criteria you have to meet for a single digit percentage opportunity. Over my tenure at Slalom, I saw the best people leave left and right for better opportunities and that should tell you everything you need to know."
235,Slalom,Can't speak highly enough.,2021-02-04,5.0,Talent Acquisition Analyst,"Shortly after starting I met Paul Schurr, General Manager of the Atlanta Office. He reminded me of Slalom's mission: ""To help you reach for and realize your vision."" He emphasized that this is not just for clients; it's also for employees. He said (as verbatim as I can recall):

""My goal is to ensure that when you leave Slalom--whether that time comes in one year or ten years--you'll be better equipped, skilled, connected, and empowered than when you arrived, so that you when you do go on to the next thing you'll be in a better position to do it, and do well, than if you had worked anywhere else.""

Talk about investing in your people.

In my year at Slalom, I witnessed leaders in all stages of their careers deliver exceptionally for their clients while facilitating the growth of everyone around them. Even the executive team was available for one-on-one conversations. As an analyst (entry level) this blew me away. 

Slalom goes above and beyond to support your growth as both a professional and an individual. I was especially impressed by their employee resource groups, their commitment to giving back locally, their quick and transparent adaption to Covid, and their response to the Black Lives Matter movement. They don't just talk, they take real action. Slalom demonstrated, in real time, the ideals within talent acquisition, engagement, and culture that drew me to this field.

They fully embody their #loveyourfuture motto.","Slalom has a startup feel, there's a lot of autonomy (this is a pro). They've grown explosively (also a pro). Currently, they're in the midst of adapting their structures to better support the scale they've reached and the scale they aspire to (forward thinking leadership, another pro). This means that a lot of their ""how we do things"" is evolving. If you want to stand firmly in either a startup vibe or a multinational corporate vibe, Slalom is not the place for you. If you find change exciting and want to play a part, you'll love it."

237,Slalom,Great company - terrible local market (St Louis),2021-05-11,4.0,Principal Consultant,Run by some of the smartest most caring authentic people who create a great culture as a company. Smart people.,"Too much autonomy given to local markets (cities) can (and did) lead to abuses, politics, and a lot of ugliness that will take years to correct. Culture of the company doesn't necessarily translate to the local market. While some corrections have been made, several of those who created the issues remain in leadership positions. I wish the company well but I could never imagine going back there with that cast of characters. Problems include:
* Politics, cliques, favoritism (promoting friends, unwritten rules, ostracize those who do not ""play the game"") 
* Saying the right things publicly, doing the wrong things privately
* Huge focus on new age mystical philosophy with a meaningful disregard for operating a business
* Lack of local leadership (Lots of charisma and personality, but not substance)
* Popularity as important (or more) as capability 
* All hands meetings felt like pep rallies, carefully crafted to generate buzz over substance
* Gaslighting by those in positions of power if questioned by those who aren't in their circle / play their games"

Extremely people focus, they want you to have a life, they only ask for reasonable time commitments and they support you with everyone in the practice. They see their employees as individuals and they embrace diversity, i never felt like i was a resource to be utilized while working at slalom. Caring, thoughtful leadership, especially in middle management. My two managers over my tenure were exceptional and stuck their neck out for me time and time again. I will always respect and admire this companies commitment to their people and focus on inclusion.","Some client work became a bit repetitive or not very interesting. Always the chance you get stuck on a long engagement that you don't have a substantial interest in, however you could always keep your sanity with internal work that could fit your interest better.

After working under management across various projects, you come to find that these ""leaders"" have very poor management skills and are not experts in their respective industries. You also find senior consultants acting as project managers who really struggle to manage a team and produce quality deliverables. As other reviewers have mentioned, many employees come from the same local consulting firm as the the person running the office.

The head of the office, who initially comes across as very caring and involved during the interview process, is really quite cold and plays extreme favoritism. Top management enthusiastically speak at office events but lack the decency to even try to familiarize themselves with all employees. You see certain teams put on a pedestal whereas some are not even given a shred of importance, and this is all based on the $$$ they are bringing to the company. Slalom dc is not as different from other consulting firms as it claims to be.

The work done has low impact/value to customers as projects are too short to even make much of a difference; But there is a high learning curve for employees. The combination of these leads to stressful and often meaningless projects."

Slalom has great relationships with our clients because we sell and staff locally so I'm not burned out on travel and have an ideal work/life balance. #WLB The payoff: I feel empowered to dream big, deliver bigger and have fun doing it.","Untraining consultants who come from Big4  firms is a challenge. What got you There won't get you Here. Slalom is not hierarchical, it's more family where you need to trust, be respectful, and lead with empathy.  For those who  try to bend the Slalom culture to their familiar ways, it's painful for all involved.  Typically, people either embrace the culture in the first year or they move on."
308,Slalom,Slalom Managers the worst,2021-04-21,1.0,Senior Consultant,"Lots of new projects and technologies to work on, not necessarily on one's own domain","Speedy burn-out due to numerous reviews and pressure to exceed every time. Managers are pressured to perform, this in-turn translates to employees being pressured to work themselves to exhaustion. Slaloms policy is to work the employee out to the max. Every which way. Grow Slalom, Customer Love, Exceed Client Expectations, Reviews, Leadership initiatives, Technology and Practice growth targets. Simply performing at client site is also not enough. It gets overwhelming. I don't think a Senior Consultant can keep a healthy family life with all the targets flying around."

They do their best to be socially responsible of the current social landscape recognizing BLM and gay rights efforts and organizing awareness events.   They have done great offering support during Covid 19.,Highly focused on billings hours so I miss many of the fun events to ensure I don't lose my bonus.  There is no exemption when there are company events.  Missing work to attend Conant training or company meetings you must work overtime to make up hours.   They also encourage you to work 44 hour work week instead of 40.  I would also love to see even more diversity in the Houston office.

The company is committed to transparency. Slalom Portland leaders have a track record of communicating openly and honestly about what's working and what's not. In fact, this is the most transparent company that I've ever worked for.

Slalom Consultants are overwhelmingly smart, talented, and collaborative.

Most people I worked with at Slalom were nice to work with.You do get your share of jerks. 

If you like networking/work events, Slalom generally has plenty of them. We've had them in places like Disneyland, Knotts Berry farm etc. Those are fun.

It feels like the top leadership genuinely cares about having a people centric company. But since each location is kind of run as an independent smaller company, each has its own culture.","You need to be an extrovert to get noticed. Since most of your work is staff aug, your management chain is mostly unaware of your work. 

I joined Slalom with the assumption (based on what was told by my recruiter and hiring manager) that they do a lot of consulting work, but turned out most of the work was staff aug.

For the few consulting projects that Slalom did, there is a lot of overpromise on the timelines and the end product.

When the company grows you hire a lot of folks from outside and you'll see the culture changing. For all its faults, I used to like working at Slalom in my initial couple of years. Then our team grew and we had a lot of new leadership who cared more about their growth and the money they can bring.

1) My experience is that Slalom does not have a sales culture. Make sure to ask a lot of questions about the support you will receive in a team selling model. Will your manager support you ? 
2) Slalom's compensation plan and benefits package is from the 90's. Read closely. Earned bonuses or commissions are discretionary. Read the compensation plan closely and make sure you are comfortable with it. 
3) Slalom sides with the company if there is a bonus/commissions dispute and will look for ways not to pay sales."

346,Slalom,Toxic Work Culture and No Career Path,2021-01-10,3.0,Consultant,"Slalom was founded on core values. When I began, these core values weren't simply decorations on the wall. Management and leadership truly valued them and would step in when employees did not uphold these core values. Formerly, the culture was vibrant and all were invited to have a seat at the table.","Slalom has several systemic issues:
- The ""inclusive"" culture touted by white males on LinkedIn isn't actually inclusive. Diversity is approached as a check the box rather than an actual shift in mindset where diverse backgrounds are included at the table.
- Slalom expects a volunteer group of women to solve the sexist culture. Recently, women have been promoted to ""management"" to positions and this is showboated to the company of hey look we hired a woman! We are so not sexist. They hire women into inclusion and diversity and HR positions rather than President, GM of a region, or other more strategic positions. The strategic positions are pretty much held by all men. 
- Slalom doesn't have a clear career trajectory. Their thought is their new framework will solve all their problems when in reality, they haven't done any work to address the heart of the problem. Slalom needs to give managers training (such an easy win), and allow them to not be fully utilized so they can support their direct reports. Tell me if someone has a family or a sick mom or can't put in the 60+ hour work week, how are they supposed to succeed and support their direct reports?"

351,Slalom,Great Foundations,2019-09-15,5.0,Client Service Lead,"This organization has one of the best value systems of any company I've come across. They truly value their people, and do as much as they can for a professional services company to support them, make them happy, and give them a place to grow their careers.  Don't like you commute? Don't like your project or role? Okay, we'll help you find one that's a better fit. What would work better for you?  I've been amazed at the focus and quality of the conversations around people and culture within the leadership team. 

Similar to Southwest Airlines, by focusing on their employees, Slalom trusts that their clients will be well taken care of, and that financial results will take care of themselves.  This is a huge asset for the company, as they have a deep sense of what matters to their employees and clients.","The autonomy afforded each office is great for many reasons, but it also comes with some downsides - namely that the wheel often gets recreated between offices, and you may be finding yourself asking ""Where have we addressed this challenge elsewhere in the business?""  It is a wonderful feeling to have autonomy and authority to build the business as you see fit, but with the scale that Slalom has, it'd be nice if some corporate functions were invested in a bit more."

There is a genuine focus on taking care of our consultants so that they enjoy the work they are doing.,"There is systemic racism in the company and it's evident by looking at the racial makeup of the senior leadership team. One of the companies ten core values is to celebrate authenticity. But you're far more likely to be promoted if you're white or can effectively 'act white' at all times around other executives so they always feel comfortable. The company will use code words like 'culture fit' when assessing promotions and external hires and hidden behind that is making sure that the status quo isn't changed. The status quo is that 19 out of 20 senior executives is white. 

To get promoted your accomplishments need to far exceed any white peers and you need spend tremendous energy to make sure all white leaders feel very comfortable with your presence, so avoid any confrontation, even healthy discussions."

369,Slalom,Flexible work life while working with cutting edge technologies,2019-08-22,5.0,Consultant,"I really enjoy working at Slalom. I love that I am not stuck traveling weekly anymore, but still am able to work with the newest cloud technologies. I feel like Slalom doesn't cheap out on their employees, the company hosts a lot of events (happy hours/team events) which always have continuous free food and drinks. Little things like this mean a lot to me. When we have more formal events like State of the Office or Quarterly events, you can tell that the they actually take time to organize and make these enjoyable events, rather than just scrape up some things to talk about with last minute preparation.

In addition to all of the above, I also am a fan of Slalom's annual retreat. It is a unique perk to have a weekend getaway covered for yourself and your significant other - with the rest of the office. A cool way to get to know your colleagues, who really end up becoming your friends.

Culture is also a great part about Slalom. If you come from a larger consulting company, you will likely experience some culture shock when you're no longer treated as just a number. Instead, you'll find snacks/drinks in the office and people shooting each other with nerf guns.

Finally, given the company is still growing so quickly, I feel there is a lot of potential for career growth.","There aren't many to be honest. Our current 401k match is 50% of contributions, up to 6% of your salary in total. Although this is pretty decent as it is, I think it would make Slalom and even more unique and desirable place if this was an even more competitive benefit."
370,Slalom,Trust local reviews: experience varies by market,2020-12-15,3.0,Senior Consultant,"I haven't met a consultant I did not enjoy as a person. Everyone is kind, a team player, and committed to working hard. 

There are a strong set of firm values that the organization uses regularly to drive culture. This provides an anchor for explaining decisions, delivering feedback (mostly positive, sometimes constructive), and evaluating performance. 

If you're in a market with great leadership, there are good opportunities to explore, innovate, grow, and advance.  If you're not...","Corporate leadership evaluates market performance first by utilization--not revenues. That translates to a ""just get them staffed"" mentality, creating some of the  shortcomings referenced in other reviews:  
-Focus on billing hours, as opposed to doing what's right for the client
Little concerted investment in product/service innovation
-Pressure on those who want to move up to do bill 40 and then do the job above them to prove themselves 
-A broken performance management system that rewards hours--not revenues. 

These experiences are not universal; read the reviews and you'll see that average ratings and NPS scores vary by market. The senior leadership team of each market has autonomy to run their business as they see fit. As a team member within the market, there's almost 0 opportunity to  provide feedback/ open conversations about negative patterns/behaviors at that SLT level in a safe way.  

I'm not sure if its a product of my market's SLT (which is a black box when it comes to decision-making) or the firm, but I've been told by many that moving up will require that you demonstrate you can do the job you want while also hitting the targets for the job you have. So, bill 40 hours per week to meet your utilization target (it's 87.5% and PTO counts against you, so don't take vacation or spend any time on the bench!), sell a few high-value engagements (with little sales support to open doors), contribute to internal initiatives, then ""tell a compelling story."" Then maybe you can get that next role. Or maybe you can continue to work 50 to 60 (or more) hours a week hoping for better luck next year... Bottom line, work-life balance only exists for those who don't want to move up and promotions are not guaranteed even if you came with significant experience in sales/practice leadership before joining. So, don't come in as a consultant unless you want to stay there or you have the foresight to negotiate a promotion timeline when you take the job. 

I hope this explanation of how different markets operates helps explain the variability in reviews. I don't believe those negative reviewers are necessarily disgruntled employees; they're probably in a market with leadership challenges, not receiving opportunities to do work that is impactful or challenging, have no clear growth path, and/or are not in a high-visibility clique (as one reviewer described). I feel those things some days and it's rough."

The people are truly at the center of the company, and the way leadership has navigated recent events in 2020 is inspiring. Slalom's core values are taken very seriously, and it's awesome to see team members actually live out these principles on a daily basis. I'm truly grateful to be here, and am excited to see the company continue to grow in the coming years.",The career path/promotion process can feel vague and ambiguous at times.

403,Slalom,Wasted over a year of my career with this firm,2020-05-19,1.0,Consultant,The office space is nice.,"This company preaches client love, but I did not see any of that during my tenure at Slalom. The things that leadership would say behind the clients' back disgusted me. Of course they need your help and your expertise - that's why you're there! It's inappropriate to make comments such as ""their mindset is still in the stone ages"" or ""they have no idea what they're talking about"". It's our responsibility to help them improve and elevate their current processes. I worked at my previous consulting firm for over 7 years and I had never encountered such vile leadership with such a superiority complex. 

In terms of career, I was never placed in the role which I was promised during the interview process. They will say they try their best to place people in the right roles but don't be fooled. Slalom has a tough time competing with the Big 4; therefore, they've made their mark in a small number of the same roles. 

Also, don't expect to have work-life balance. I live in the city and commuted 3.5 hours a day to Deerfield for months on end without a WFH option. I spoke with my people manager about this, but she was too passive and didn't want to make waves, hence I was stuck without options."

405,Slalom,Not a good place to work for women in tech,2020-12-14,2.0,Consultant,"Most people are very nice and friendly. The culture is pretty good too, as they have a lot of employee activities after hours. They have lots of happy hours, a retreat and quarterlies with food and beverages. I guess it's not that great for people that don't drink alcohol. I would say the best of the company are the ERG's, which are very diverse and constantly have meetups and talks of their topic of interests.","I don't recommend you to work here if you're a woman in tech or want to transition to tech. They might promise you'll have opportunities to work in projects that will help you develop tech skills, but that's probably a lie.
The Technology Enablement department has a big bro culture and their App Development group is sexist. Unless you have a lot of years in experience in tech, you'll probably will be signed in to projects that are more business oriented because that's most of their contracts. For some reason, a lot of the contracts they get in TE get cancelled after they have been announced. This kept happening way before the pandemic. 
I know many women with tech skills that were very capable and left less than a year because they kept getting administrative work, or they were just treated poorly. Their TE leadership just doesn't know how to promote their skills and capabilities to the clients well, and they don't know how to treat them respectfully. They might offer a competitive salary as a consultant, but not as a software engineer. Honestly, if you can afford to, try getting a job somewhere else.

They don't offer sick days, so most people have to save their PTO's in case they get sick."

I’m constantly impressed by the caliber of people I work with day in day out and how corporate leadership is looking to build a company that will endure to serve the world. I have constant opportunities to share and own my ideas. Benefits overall are great including recent enhancements to parenting leave - the company is constantly looking out for its people and listens to feedback that it receives.

The leadership offers a lot of transparency that I have not seen from other organizations. Upper management will make an effort to get to know you. Of all the places I have worked they try hard to support their clients and employees. I do not feel like a number here. I do appreciate the organization's efforts around inclusion and diversity.,It is a struggle to establish internal processes.

450,Slalom,Great Culture,2020-12-11,5.0,Management Consultant,People-first culture and leadership. Creativity and unique approaches to solutions are valued.,Salary and benefits not as competitive as the bigger firms
451,Slalom,Cliquey culture dictates growth opportunities,2020-12-18,1.0,Consultant,"- You can work on a variety of projects at different industries, gaining exposure to a lot of different areas.

- The culture can be fun. A lot of coworkers are friends and will hang out outside of work. 

- Slalom does a nice job with Quarterly meetings, though it can be a bit of a drunk-fest.

- Work/life balance is what you make of it. You can easily keep a 40 hr workweek. This is nice if you have a family.

- The good people managers are very good and genuinely care about you.

- A lot of ERGs if you want to get involved in more efforts outside of your typical consulting projects.

- I consider the executive team (Brad, John, etc) to be transparent communicators about where the company is going.

Unfortunately the Pros are overshadowed by the list of Cons below.","- “High School”: It’s a juvenile culture. People drink a lot, co-workers date and hook up, people gossip. There are cliques, which completely dictate whether you’re included/excluded in opportunities .

- Cliques and Favoritism: People use the phrase “inner circle” to describe the cliques within Slalom. The “Inner Circle” is typically a group of people with leadership titles and who have been with the company for awhile. If you are in the ‘Inner Circle’ you’re golden - they’ll pull you into growth opportunities and leadership conversations, and your career within the company can take off. If you’re not in the clique, it doesn’t matter how much you do, you won’t be included in any growth considerations.

- Unclear/Limited Opportunities for Growth: Slalom is a flat organization. It’s well-defined what each role is (e.g., MD, PAL, CSL, CM). But, jumping from one to the other is ambiguous and entirely dependent on the relationships you build within the company (see above point). In my experiences, I saw multiple average/low performers move up because they buddied up with CSPs or MDs, while high performers who didn’t specifically befriend the higher ups were glossed over and eventually left the company. Very sad.

- No Growth Development Framework: Slalom does a poor job of grooming leaders. There is no formal process of rating performance, or managing high performers. I’ve seen many top performers get frustrated with going above and beyond and not moving up, while others who buddy-up with the MDs get chosen for growth without doing much.

- Elements of a Toxic Culture: Given the above, Slalom has many elements of toxic workplace culture. Favoritism is a huge part of one’s path in the company. As an example, I was personally workplace-bullied by someone for months who saw me as a “threat” to getting promoted. I eventually left due to this behavior (and other things), while the other got promoted even after not hitting key metrics and being on the bench for over a quarter. Wow. Care to take a guess on why? See the above few points.

- Awkward Diversity and Inclusion Rollout: Slalom has been trying to make strides in diversity and inclusion (which is a great thing…and also interesting given my comments above on favoritism). When this first kicked off, there were at least a couple DI leads who told other individuals that they shouldn’t be promoted based on their gender or skin color, because they were trying to even out the quotas. Yikes. I hope they’ve gotten things together and are on a more inclusive path."

What makes this group stand out is their commitment and drive to do better each day for their clients and each other. The people I’ve encountered here are amazing, and a pleasure to be around, or have a drink with.

I’ve been a part of the Salesforce team here in Scottsdale for a little while now, and I can say that my teammates are some of the most talented architects and engineers that I’ve worked with.

- A good culture
- The snacks are top notch
- Work/life balance (but because the work is not challenging at all)","The work is absolutely boring. Majority of the projects revolve around project/program management - so if you really want to dive deep into an industry and try to learn/understand nuances to it, the projects here won't allow it. Forget about any actual ""strategy"" projects that challenge you. The worst part is I was sold a different bill of goods - projects that are challenging, exciting, and trans-formative. Considering how much I've learned at my previous stops in my professional life, it's sad to say I have learned absolutely nothing of value at Slalom. Even when you try to engage those folks who are considered ""experts"" in an industry, you quickly realize the expertise is surface level - when you try to go a deeper level, it goes over their heads. Slalom is good at making you feel great upfront when you start, but you will quickly realize meaningful work is hard to come by. Also, don't expect leadership to provide any guidance - they seem pretty clueless on what's going on and always make false assurances."

- Awesome network of resources around the nation

- People-focused (for the most part, not all-inclusive)

- If you're a 29-45 year old consultant, this is the place for you. Great people, but the vast majority of the office falls into that age group. If you're coming straight out of college, I personally would've potentially preferred a different firm.","- Leadership loves and welcomes the word diversity but the only diversity I've observed them pursue until recently is gender parity. As a person of color, I didn't feel they completely had my interests at heart until there was pressure from the world.

- Talked about during the interview process and confirmed within 2 months of starting, I brought up work travel, asking if there were opportunities. They said I could if that was what I desired. To that, I said I want to travel as close to 100% as possible. It's been over a year since I started and I haven't gotten an opportunity to travel for projects.

- Earlier in the interview process, I asked if I would be acting in an individual contributor on projects. I'm a growing professional who wants to learn from the intelligent people at Slalom. They said I wouldn't be alone. The last two projects I've been assigned to, I've either been the only Slalom employee at the client or the only Slalom resource on the project.

- Slalom told me I would receive a promotion in 6-12 months if I delivered after I started. About 9 months in, I took the initiative to play a role on a project two promotions above my current position. I delivered well, the client trusted me from the beginning of the project, and we worked well together. Thirteen months later, even after delivering exceptionally, I'm still promotion-less with a promotion date that stands as TBD."

516,Slalom,"Great Culture, Perks, Coworkers",2019-11-13,5.0,Marketing,Slalom really depends on its values and keeps them at the focus of their daily business. They have nice offices and are continuing to grow. The interview process is really one of the best processes I had and everyone so far has been just as kind and helpful as day one.,Snacks and drinks are so popular they aren't always well stocked! Not the worst thing in the world. Really have to negotiate a fair salary but they will budge after presenting an offer. It is slightly offensive that you can be told a number during the interview process then be offered a number 10-20k less than discussed.

They talk a big talk about diversity because it's necessary to attract talent  in a  tight job market.  But the reality is that if you are a minority, the odds are your mission is to staff undesirable positions just to help management meet their financial  targets.  If you don't mind a job with no real growth, or if you are in it for the short haul,  go for Slalom DC.  But if you are counting on real long-term growth, take a shortcut and look elsewhere.  To reiterate what other reviewers have written about Slalom DC, this is a staffing agency masquerading as a consulting company.  Limited opportunities exist but not for minorities. Another common complaint I hear from employees is the bull job interviews where they promise you  quality work. Once you join, you will soon discover that Slalom DC goes after crumbs and contracts other vendors turn down."

The vast majority of people who manage to receive a promotion will tell you the process was excruciating. Middle managers need training in effectively guiding their direct reports through the promotion process.

-I was extremely impressed with our CEO, Executive leaders in Seattle, as well as my local executive team in Denver. However, my particular practice area was led by a PAL that consistently belittled and humiliated her direct reports. Her power hungry, people pleasing, micro-managing behavior created a toxic environment. The only condolence was that the vast majority of consultants on our team felt the same way and we could support each other through her harsh treatment. I want to emphasize that I am referring to one specific PAL, and I do believe that other PALs were very good at people management and well liked by their direct reports."

- Customer Experience (Salesforce) team is a brand new Salesforce practice in Slalom's Arizona Market. Unfortunately, they are not utilizing  resources, materials, or methodologies from the rest of Slalom's established Salesforce practices, which makes for an inconsistent brand message and a premature practice.

- Slalom's Arizona market is run more like a franchise model instead of sharing in Slalom's success.

- Many roles on a Salesforce project are filled by a PM with no Salesforce experience, who wants to ""try something new"".

- There is an extreme lack of accountability. One of the core principles is to be your ""Genuine Self"" but there is no hierarchy of accountability. If you have an issue with a coworkers style or handling of a client, its up to you to tell them no matter where you sit in the chain of command. Makes for a very uncomfortable situation that everyone avoids so crazy people, stay crazy.

-Fun work events.
-Occasional free lunch.","-Processes and systems are constantly changing due to inefficiencies and constant trouble shooting.
-Management are unwilling to consider 'outside of the box' thinking or suggestions with regard to inefficient/manual processes. 
-Career advancement/promotions are unlikely unless you kiss up to management by taking work home/take on additional projects.
-Work-life balance is not promoted, as most supervisors will encourage team to take laptops home and plug-in.
-Lack of diversity. I believe HR's definition of diversity is geared at hiring women first and foremost, rather than the inclusion of minorities and folks of the LGBT community.
-HR will drag their feet with the hiring process due to delayed responses and are unwilling to negotiate salary upon hiring. 
-Lack of accountability seems to be a common theme among management and account/sales teams. Much blame and responsibility will fall on analysts and specialists when processes are not running smoothly."

Regional programs mean that people are actually traveling more often, which goes against one of the main reasons that people join the company in the first place.

577,Slalom,Great career move,2019-07-26,5.0,Consultant,"Working at Slalom is my first foray into consulting. I was a bit wary of the jump into consulting having only worked in internal roles in the past, but I'm quite glad I made the move. Everyone here is so sharp and easy to work with. The work can be intense and challenging at times, but not so much so that I feel at all burnt out.  You get to tackle difficult and interesting projects with a team of smart people from different professional backgrounds.

Pay and benefits are competitive, and there's some great perks like catered breakfast on Fridays and a fancy weekend away in the summer. I got a pretty generous number of vacation days to start, which is great (and I think much better than the supposedly ""unlimited"" vacation days many tech companies offer).

I've probably learned more in the first 4 months here than I did in the last 2 years at my last job. Overall, coming to Slalom was a great career move for me.","Health benefits are expensive compared to previous companies. HMO is not available in Massachusetts so I need to buy more expensive PPO. Compensation is good overall though.

Working on site at clients all the team means I don't get a lot of face time with my manager and members of my team, but Slalom puts on lots of events for the office and each team to get together occasionally. You do get tight with your project team though.

Hours can sometimes be long and you might need to put in some time over weekends from time to time, but I there's not a super intense workaholic culture here. There are periods if intensity, but most of the time things are fairly flexible. You get a good number of PTO days each year and you are actually encouraged to take time off. This is not an extremely low-stress job, but it probably won't burn you out either."
578,Slalom,Great Place to Work,2020-06-30,4.0,Account Coordinator,"Culture, Leaderships openness to feedback, Office and flexibility",I've noticed that some times employees are given false promises and the office paints a better picture than what is reality in regard to office finances.

Still able to find decent talent after exhausting most consultants' local networks.  National team is still able to visit local offices regularly to stay in touch.  Still good at implementing feedback from consultant surveys.,"Offices have become rife with in efficiency over the years.  Underperforming consultants can fly under the radar and don't get ""counseled out"" early enough putting pressure on their team and account management to cover for them. ELT is severely dysfunctional and it is apparent throughout the org. SLT have been stripped of most power and doesn't make decisions although they are running the business. CSLs and PALs do 90% of the leadership work but are paid badly, underappreciated and given no career guidance to get to the next level.  To get promoted you have to pick the right MD and ride their coattails to the top. Expecting your performance to be decider of promotion is a myth: it is now purely a political game. And if one MD harbors a grudge against a consultant, it will severely impact their growth at the company. Sadly, this company made its mint by hiring big 4 consultants and thinking they would be different because of the local model but they have just become a big 4 firm that focuses on financials before people.   The company grew too fast and gave up its soul in the process."

588,Slalom,Have an honest conversation with yourself before  joining,2019-11-18,2.0,Consultant,Strong cloud and business advisory practice and practice leaders.,Highly progressive culture.  Shared work space in WeWork.  Comp plan not aligned to account and territory plans.  Expense policy can create hardship on employee.   No 401K match first year.
589,Slalom,Solid firm for those who want to do business development,2020-06-09,3.0,Solutions Architect,"Caring people, caring leadership, good salary",Limited career path for individual contributors and therefore inability to retain good senior talent
590,Slalom,"Three years in, this is definitely the best company I've ever worked for",2017-02-06,5.0,Consultant Manager,"- Compensation is fair.  I've personally witnessed people receiving 10+% raises because leaders did a market evaluation and found that their folks were not making enough.  I've always felt well-compensated.
- Culture is outstanding.  If you stay plugged-in to company events, you will feel like part of a family.  I've gone through some personal issues recently, and the amount of people who have reached out offering support, hugs, dinner, beers has been hugely impactful to me.  There is a family feel with this company that I have only found at one other place in my career.  And as we grow, it's clear the leaders are concerned about fostering this culture and not letting it slip away.
- Events are top-notch.  Skedaddle, the yearly all-expense getaway weekend in the mountains, continues to be a huge draw for me.  I love getting to kick back and spend the weekend with coworkers/friends.  The Christmas party, summer picnic, Rockies opener tailgate, and other events are all well-done and fun.
- The company is willing to be self-critical.  The Widening the Circle training, for all of it's ""diversity rah rah"" has a great introspective point to it.  We identified the ""typical Slalomer"": avid drinker, young, preppy, college-educated, white, among others.  And it makes us think about the people we may be missing out on because we aren't stepping out of our typical circles to find folks that are just as good if not better, but don't look/act like a typical Slalomer.  And I've seen results from the training: we offer more events where drinking isn't a central point--variety is great!
- Leadership is open.  I've witnessed very frank questions from coworkers to both office and national leadership, and have heard frank answers.  The leadership at all levels (barring a few folks in the Denver office) is very approachable, personable, and honest.  When things go wrong, they own it.  When things don't pan out, they analyze why not and tell us.  We have insight into company financials and plans on both year and multi-year forecasts.
- Work/life balance is modeled by leadership for the most part.  I've seen practice directors take additional time off after having children.  I've had coworkers who moved to a 4-day week to support their personal life needs.  All of these changes are supported wherever possible.  Consultants have the right to say ""no"" to a project that won't fit their desired work/life balance.","- Benefits, particularly 401k match, could use some work.  The company has made strides in the benefits area, but they are still not at the level I expect from a world-class company.
- The ITP process (Intent to Pursue--the promotion process) is not fun for most people that endure it.  I've seen two quality coworkers get stuck in ITP with objectives met but no appetite for their promotion.  We lost both of them to other companies because they were fed up with not having the promotion occur.  ITP is different for different people and roles, as well.  Some people it seems don't even go through it, while for others it takes a year.  I haven't talked to a single person who has gone through ITP that thought it was valuable.
- If you aren't willing to put in the time to see and be seen at outside events, your mobility is limited.  I don't necessarily see this as a con, but I'm putting it out there for those who expect quality work to be the sole promotion force.  Slalom still has a solid group of Consultants who just want to do the work and go home, and that is supported and not in any way deterred."

Admirable values that respect the client and community - no billing unnecessarily, or volunteering services that aren't our strengths. Lots of emphasis on social giving and charities.
Fun events - from recurring office events to the awesome annual shindigs 
Small close-knit market - ability to help shape and build the team and get to know everyone.
Impressive growth trajectory as a company","Meaningful work - engagements tend to be high profile staff augmentation as the company works to grow exposure and move up market. (There are some teams working on case study worthy consulting work, but it's a minority of the company)
Limited client base - partially driven by the Hartford market, partially driven by the fact that we are still growing here (trending positive in the past 6 months)
Vacation is non-negotiable - however leadership is flexible in supporting consultant needs.
Lack of process/formalized career path - I think this is a positive, but some folks miss the opportunity of knowing the rigid steps they need to hit to climb the consulting ladder
Diversity of background - experience tends to be from consulting backgrounds, however, this has gotten much better in the past 6 months."
