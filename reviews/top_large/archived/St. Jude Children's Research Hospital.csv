Staff wants to move forward, but because leadership is stifled in their thinking, progress was often slow or none existent in the IT department. IT is not a promote based on merit environment, but on who do you like. 
Doesn't really matter if the people are qualified as leaders. Also, pay disparity exists between women and men. I would look elsewhere if this is important to you."

I have honestly had a really great time with my lab but friends in other labs have brought up really strict and overbearing PIs. A lot of people I’ve talked to have also mentioned a very competitive environment.

It's now a common knowledge that a lot of people are quitting. St. Jude doesn't appreciate their employees! Management allows people, especially white male, to ""walk all over"" minorities! 
It has no system in place where employees can complain completely anonymously, if they face sexism and racism. 
Take a look at the employee directory: you'll see that all higher-up positions are crowded by white, middle-aged men! 
Petty salary. 
No scope for promotions, continuing-education, professional development! Rather managers discourage these aspects of career development."

66,St. Jude Children's Research Hospital,Wonderful Community & an Amazing Place to Work,2021-09-14,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"I love the community, the campus, the environment.
There are many tools to help you succeed and prosper.
Executives are not micromanagers and team leads are allowed to be very flexible with their teams. We have employees from all around the world and the diversity is amazing! They allow all departments and team managers to create their own schedules for their teams with the ability to work remote or hybrid remote/campus. Benefits are AMAZING! We have an onsite clinic, pharmacy, car wash, gym, 2 starbucks, a bank,and literally anything else you can ever need. Words can't describe the amazing things that happen at St. Jude. It truly is a blessing to be a part of this community!","However, there seems to be a drastic contrast of privilege between hourly employees and those working salary. Those who are salary can come and go as they wish and their PTO balances are astronomical because they arent micromanaged like hourly employees despite hourly employees working twice as hard and having to be here 8 full hours everyday! Department chairs are practically non-existent in operations & it all falls on administration and direct managers which is an absolute nightmare because one manager can be super cool and the other can be an evil person! for example, our department does not have a dress code. If my manager sees me without dress slacks on EVERYDAY, I am publicly scolded in front of my coworkers. Work schedules are up to the team managers and every single manager in our department is very flexible and very nice to their employees. For me, if I am not here at 8AM on the dot, I get publicly scolded in front of my coworkers. I get asked almost on a weekly basis why I ""don't work overtime like my coworkers""... Over 75% of our department is remote and my team manager insists on our entire team being onsite every day when 90%+ of our work load is virtual and more than half of our department is empty. Need to make up an hour of work this weekend because of a doctors appointment you had on Tuesday? cool, no problem! Can you do it remotely on a project that has been sitting on hold for months? NO, you are forced to sit in traffic for an hour and come onsite to make up that one hour. I understand that this is the general difference between hourly and exempt employees, but the level at which the privileges contrast, its depressing. There is no oversight on power tripping managers and it becomes miserable when you see how everyone else in your department is so happy and comfortable while your manager is a nightmare. Directors, managers, and department chairs speak amongst themselves and if you try to apply to another department, your manager will find out through the ""great vine"" and it makes things very awkward and it jeopardizes your application to the other department. You feel trapped when you have a bad/evil manager.
Lastly, if you are applying to any job at St. Jude that lists ""And anything else that maybe asked of you"" or something along those terms in the job description, RUN!!!! This means you will be forced into doing executive level tasks that are waaaaay above your pay grade and there is nothing you can do about it."
67,St. Jude Children's Research Hospital,Be bold and earn a living loving why you work!,2021-09-11,5.0,Teksystems Consultant,Working at St. Jude through Tek Systems was a wonderful opportunity! St. Jude is on the cutting edge in so many ways and knowing that every effort I made in digital and personalization was impacting children's lives was truly motivating. My co-workers and manager were nice and helpful. It's not a cushy-family-style workplace but I don't need that. They were good people doing the best job possible. The Tek systems crew was helpful and did nice things like give the contract employees a small gift for Christmas and we did lunch with just the contractors.,"Be aware that Tek Systems will try to lowball you. Know your worth. They are nice but its still business. Also, You must be outspoken or sometimes you will get steamrolled. People who are a bit more introverted can be overlooked or your contributions may be attributed to someone else. I'm a team player but if make the shots I don't like others takening credit. You didn't hear Scotty's name after Jordan dunked, right?"

I feel like St. Jude looks out for my health and well-being. I love having an onsite pharmacy and clinic; it makes it way easier for me to keep appointments during the day. 

I respect our administrative leadership's efforts to better increase and highlight diversity and inclusion. Our workforce is very diverse, but it's nice to see that it's increasingly celebrated. In the past year we've formed the women's + allies resource group and the Black employees + allies resource group. They, along with our PRIDE group, are doing some incredible things on campus. I feel lucky to be a part of these groups and help celebrate our diversity.

We mandated the vaccine!!! I feel valued and safe and also very proud that we are taking steps to protect our patients and their families, as well as each other and each other's families. 

St. Jude churns out some powerful and world-changing research. Our resources and our faculty are top-notch; I am always so proud to be in Memphis and a part of this incredible institution. Working in HR, I love to be a part of hiring, training, and elevating employees. I believe that we are equipped and empowered to be some of the best.","It's a pandemic, so we are BUSY. We're tired and stressed. We've been forced to make some changes in some of our departments to better handle the pandemic. Some of us have transitioned to remote work (guess that's not really a con for most people though). But I feel like I have been supported by this organization even on the rough days and I look forward to when I can return to complaining about something way less serious, like our Starbucks line being too long."

81,St. Jude Children's Research Hospital,Nurses are dispensable and it shows,2021-08-12,3.0,Registered Nurse,"Benefits are great, most team mates believe in our mission and have a passion for pediatric oncology. Unit managers are mostly great. Somewhat flexible scheduling in some departments. Diversity is a focus.","Lots of changes have happened in the last 3 years to move away from being a unique and wonderful place to work and more toward a generic, typical hospital setting. St. Jude used to have a very nice night shift differential, but that was significantly decreased not long ago. I recently learned a nurse that started less than a year ago makes 12.5% more than me per hour (without her differential) and I’ve worked at the institution for years and have advanced the clinical advancement program offered (multiple certifications, trained countless employees, etc). Pediatric oncology isn’t always an easy field to work in and it’s quite a slap in the face to learn how much more new employees are being laid compared to long haulers. Administration (not direct managers, they’re wonderful) seems to put a lot of faith in the “there’s no place like St. Jude” reputation, which is reflected in the attitude of long term employees being disposable/replaceable with new hires."
82,St. Jude Children's Research Hospital,One of the best employers I've had,2021-08-12,5.0,Medication Systems Coordinator,"St. Jude has an inclusive and engaged set of employees that are an absolute pleasure to work with. Whether it's security guards, food service workers, clinical, or non-clinical staff, every interaction I've had with fellow employees has been positive. As a gay man in the south, I feel St. Jude has provided a safe space for me to be who I am, without the need to hide. This feeling has spread throughout the community of Memphis. 
St. Jude also has amazing benefits, from onsite health amenities like gym, pharmacy, and clinic, to insurance coverage for outside services, hands down one of the best benefit packages I've received from a company.","Only a limited number of employee resource groups. Possibly a lack of vertical career opportunities in specific roles. Not a con for me - but they do enforce strict policies on employees in order to keep patients healthy, as safety is the main focus."

Great nurse to patients ratio. Supportive coworkers. Great benefits among other hospitals.,"Coming from another big institution, it is pretty clear that the higher up is trying to change what makes St. Jude great and unique in term of nursing and patient care into a generic hospital.
Higher up management does not listen to nurse's voice. As proven by never following through with their promises when they come to ask for our opinion.
Nursing in the middle of pandemic is hard as it is, and not a lot of support from the higher up to retain current loyal employees.
Not a lot of nursing autonomy at St. Jude compare to others."

However, our CEO has recognized this for the problem it is, and has dedicated significant resources to overhauling and drastically improving diversity and inclusion efforts. The changes over the past year have been visible and measurable. I applaud administration for tackling this difficult topic, and having the character to both empower and improve access to opportunities for women, minorities, members of the LGBTQ+ community, immigrants, and all others that bring diversity to our faculty and staff.

As a part of the team that gets to work on some of these challenges, I am living my dream job.","St. Jude has a long reputation as being a great place to work and it is... however, the challenges of growth are complicated by employees who are resistant to change.

A mission that makes you happy to contribute, and keep coming to work. Encourage work/life balance. Job security.","Politics. Expected to make exception after exception after exception depending on who is making requests. Makes it hard to be able to explain policies and procedures when so many exceptions are made.

Infinite opportunity to learn and develop with great potential for upward mobility within the company.,"Progression up the research ladder and where employees fall along this ladder and why is somewhat vague. Salary ranges within individual positions in among research staff are extremely broad with little known about why someone may be at the lower or higher end of that pay scale. The potential for promotion is apparent, but the timeline and steps necessary to achieve such promotions is a little less clear."
357,St. Jude Children's Research Hospital,Be VERY careful and evaluate work environment before working here,2019-10-14,1.0,Postdoctoral Fellow,Salary and benefits are above average,"Highly hostile work environment complete with taunting/harassment. Coworkers refused to share information I needed to complete work. Only advice given by HR and postdoc office was to quit. Meanwhile they allow people whom are actively hostile to coworkers (not just me) to remain in their positions and do nothing to attempt to correct the behavior. The attitude of St Jude is that is you have a bad experience that “it’s not St Jude”. I disagree. St Jude is only as good as its worst work environment. There are many areas in St Jude that are highly hostile. St Jude is not special—it just has a carefully crafted image. If you’re in a bad area that image and how people blindly love St Jude only adds insult to injury. If you end up in one of the many hostile work environments here, it is a life and career altering experience."

Full health (90%), vision, and dental coverage. So many vacation days I'm now at a point where I have to take time off. Every high-tech toy a scientist could want. Oh, and free parking!

But the real reason to work at St. Jude is the work that we do here. There is one (1) cafeteria on campus, by design, so all the doctors and scientists and patient families all converge. Even if you have a terrible day in the lab/office/etc., you take one look at those beautiful babies and are reminded to get back to the fight.

I have been very fortunate to see many changes over the years and I have to say it just gets better and better.  The thing I love most about St. Jude is our mission.  There is nothing that tops giving our patients the very best care they can receive and second to that is the research that comes out of this incredible institution.  There is truly no other place I'd rather work.,"Actually the only downside to working here is the employee parking.

I feel like all members of the team are valued for their unique contributions and are included in all levels of decision-making.

I appreciate the benefits and the relationships (both personal and professional) that I've developed over the years.

Dr. Downing is the best! Thats the best and only Pro about this place...,"I have been here for quite some time. Ive made complaints about the mistreatment received and shown to not only staff but the management that has recently been hired has fallen right into the riff-raff. She's right in the middle of the gossip groups. Spreading lies and creating tremendous turmoil amongst us. The new system that was brought in has made it harder for us to do our jobs because NO ONE in this office is trained to use it properly. This is not only a hindrance for me to do my job- which I can do effortlessly- but it creates an issue for other people in the office to complain and gossip because they cannot work do to the fact they don't know HOW to work. You've hired incompetent people. From the entry level, to the top management in this office. I see so many ""immediate termination"" issues daily. Coworkers discussing patient info in front of patient family's, employees outside on personal cell phones all day, name calling with profane labels and racial slurs, security even allowed a car in with weed smoke and loud music onto the campus!! Amongst other things that management turns a blind eye to to keep it off their desk. HR knows most of this but won't do anything about it because its been documented before and hasn't changed. Im typing this review right now sitting next to 3 employees discusssing another employees FMLA status and why she needs to be fired and how they ""wish she wasn't here."" The employee they are talking about in an exemplary worker and works circles around us all...even when she misses days. She works sick, has lost her dad, her mother in law, her home amongst other issues and still manages to come and work tirelessly. But they are just bullying her with management looking right past it. Thats just one example of how much people take from others here and nothing is done. There are many other examples. The public doesn't know the darkside of this once beloved institution and rightfully so....however, if we can't get the help we need here, From the inside, outside help has to be sought and used. I love my job, and I give 200% daily all while working with a debilitating illness that keeps me struggling to stay encouraged, but I do so. But to deal with bullying, scrutiny, disrespect, name calling, incompetence, hearsay, laziness, and discrimination from this place daily is very tiring and cruel. Fix this...before it hurts this place!!!"

He has fostered an amazing culture.","However, separate, individual departments are different. St. Jude is a job just like any other job in the city. You come in with these high expectations, but quickly realize it is still a business at the end of the day. It's a great outer façade, but the inner structure needs a lot of rebuilding. Everyone here is really smart so it's super competitive with a lot of my co-workers and certain work areas are extremely stressful because of management and how they treat/talk to employees. I can only speak for my specific department.  Also, because people love St. Jude so much and don't want to retire, career advancement opportunities are slim especially in certain departments so just be ok with being stagnant for a while if you don't look for opportunities outside of your area.  A lot of people make St. Jude their lives and some of them expect you to make work your life as well."

There is a strong sense of culture and community. Leadership is very transparent with things going on in the hospital and they try very hard to promote work-life balance and the overall well-being of employees.","I am sure this problem is not specific to St Jude, but rather all graduate/postdoc trainings in academia in general. You are expected to work long tedious hours without any overtime pay, often sacrificing personal and family time. If you are not in the lab until 9 pm or on weekends, it's almost implied that you are not working hard enough. Again, this is not a problem with St Jude, but it's a general problem in academia that I don't think will change anytime soon. I do have to say that St Jude is trying very hard to push for work-life balance, but it really depends on which PI you work for and how understanding they are."

I am blown away by the amazing work our talented researchers and clinicians do on a daily basis.

St. Jude offers fantastic benefits that get better all the time, and there are a lot of opportunities to connect to people in other departments if you take advantage of them.","Diversity in executive leadership does not exist. For people of color who do aspire to leadership roles, there's no route to get there as many roles on the administrative side, where many black and Latinx employees work,  offer no growth.

What mission could possibly be more inspiring?
Despite (or maybe because of) being a non-profit, St. Jude has an attitude of doing what it takes to get results.  This means they don't skimp on cutting edge technology and that philosophy trickles down to non-research areas.  We get the tools we need.   The key words there are ""tools"" and ""needs"".    My department is  very aware  our budgets come from donor dollars so we aren't frivolous, but we do make sure people have what they need to get their work done. 
Dr. Downing  (our CEO) makes many/regular opportunities to communicate our strategies, goals, and progress.  He isn't afraid to discuss ideas and answer questions.  He is also open to explaining the reasoning behind our strategic plan.  
There is a lot of change going on, it's exciting.","Quality o f management is inconsistent across departments,  resulting in pockets of low morale and low engagement.   There are ongoing attempts to improve this situations , for example, they started a ""Leadership Academy"" for managers as well as directors, but it will take time to know whether or not it has helped.
Due to fast growth, our cubicle/office space is TINY  - also St. Jude puts it money where it's important - into spaces for patients and their families.  If you are a person who wants a large office or large cubicle, you won't find it here - but we have great outdoor space and an awesome cafeteria.

I have had to work under a leadership team that lacks almost everything necessary in order to lead our team effectively.   If you work in HR, you know which team I am writing about.  You would think to have more than 20 something years of experience in a given field that you would be able to lead your team appropriately, but that is definitely not the case for my director.

So many of the employees embody that drive and ideal. The people here know why they're here; for the patients, what brought them here. My role is administrative; I don't have regularly interactions with patients. But, having the opportunity to serve the people that change these patients and families lives everyday is such a gift.","While the vast majority of the people here are absolutely wonderful, there are some that believe they are entitled to more because of their status or degree. I understand respecting the people who have put in the time, energy, and money to obtain their degrees; but, I will never understand treating others as less than because there are a few extra letters next to your name.

Great environment for research.,"Researchers are the major contribution for the success of discoveries in the research and finding cure for patients. These researchers had PhDs and several years of postdoctoral experience. They have to work on weekends and after hours most of the time for a successful completion of experiments, findings/discoveries. 
But recently I found that people with just master’s and 1-3 years of experience are well paid in non-research areas like fund raising, information systems and other administrative jobs with mostly 8-5 work schedule. I know the motivation of the organization is not commercial but there is huge biased in the pay structure & benefits among the employees of different departments. Also, the benefits for the employees at higher level are much better, on top of high pay scales, such as tuition fee reimbursement for their children and other perks.

In addition, the researchers have very limited opportunity to grow to a higher level and be an independent researcher as they don't support the staff to write grants.
I joined the organization with lot of hopes and motivation to work for the innocent kids and their survival. But the organization focus is mostly driven towards fundraising and getting attention in the media to get more funds."

Guidelines are often placed as a last-minute measure to achieve a positive spin effect, which tends add avoidable difficulty to the simplest day to day tasks. 

Most of the upper management seems to be content with clashing over responsibility as well as shifting it. This had trickled down to a lot of their subordinates causing communication failure to become an accepted part of an employee's workday.  

Management too often becomes part of the problem and not the solution by enacting most changes and guidelines as a form of spin or protection.  Forcing most of the lower staff to spend more time playing the same game and less on their actual jobs. 

Job-related training is often scarce, off focused and last minute. 

Priorities here are mainly seen from one viewpoint making unrealistic goals and expectations a daily norm. Great work is only rewarded with more hard work."

533,St. Jude Children's Research Hospital,Management issues cloud the St Jude mission,2018-02-03,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"1.  Diverse community of talented physicians and scientists 
2. Good benefits","1.  Terrible management.  Management is the most demoralizing thing about working at St Jude.  Often employees are trapped between a direct supervisor and a ""dotted line"" supervisor, and when desires clash, or one feels that the employee is more loyal to the other, the employee loses out.  This is a no win situation that does not seem to get remedied.  
2.  No training or managerial oversight.   As a new employee, it is not an unreasonable expectation to be provided with a list of applications and tools that need to be requested (and even how to go about placing such a request) so that one can fully perform his/her job.  Training should also fall under a Director or Manager's responsibility.  Being told ""go ask ______,"" is not training.  It's very discouraging to me to see my employees were not trained well because training is contingent on who the ""trainee"" was that was responsible for imparting bits of knowledge.  The lack of training in the day-to-day mechanics of clinical research is not setting this institution up for success. 
3.  Inequity in employee treatment.  The work environment at SJ is very Orwellian:  ""All are created equal, but some are more equal than others."""

What I found most interesting about the situation is that it is tolerated at all - 50 years ago, maybe, but now it is quite strange.  And it is such common knowledge that the departmental director, admin director, and directors/faculty of other departments are aware of this behavior, frequently discussed, joked about even, but is still found to be acceptable .  I am not aware of any other faculty members behaving this way, but I still think it's is ultimately unacceptable behavior for a grown, educated adult.  And also ultimately unacceptable for such a large and world known corporation to allow this behavior as ""acceptable"" for so long and continue to do so.  Ultimately, I like working for St. Jude and currently have no plans to leave - but a little less daily stress would be nice."

641,St. Jude Children's Research Hospital,Employment with a sense of purpose,2017-04-21,5.0,Registered Nurse,"There are innumerable benefits to working with St. Jude. However, I will attempt to highlight some that I find to be most important, as I view Glassdoor as an opportunity to provide real insight to potential employees. Also, I want to clarify that my bias will be towards clinical care, as I am a registered nurse. I have no first hand knowledge of other areas.  So, as they say, caveat emptor.

First and foremost, there is our guiding mission.  ""No child should die in the dawn of life."" The work that we do on a daily basis does indeed help save lives.  I have seen advances in treatment and outcomes first hand.  It is slow and incremental, but it's there.

Our benefits are better than the norm. I've compared our benefits to other institutions over the last five years, and dollar for dollar, ours are better.  I'm sure that there are exceptions to that, based on personal needs and familial situations, but on average I'd pit our benefits package against almost any employer in Memphis. 

Work/life balance.  12 hour shifts can be brutal, but our ability to self-schedule helps ensure that we can have the time we need to recover.  There are instances where changes have to be made, and we don't always agree with them.  BUT, that's a risk you run with any employer.  We also have the added advantage of paid holidays, personal time, PTO and sick time to supplement our days away from the job.  Many of us take that for granted, but for most hospitals give employees less time away.  And they typically have ZERO paid holidays.

Non-clinical employment opportunities.  There comes a time in our lives (as nurses) where the bedside is no longer an option.  It could be age, physical condition, or mental fatigue.  Regardless, there are numerous options away from the clinical setting for those that would like a change.  Yes, there is competition. No, there aren't always positions when we want them.  But in life, patience is a virtue.

Lastly, I would say a sense of camaraderie. This is both a pro and a con. Many shifts (again, I am speaking solely to nursing) and units feel very much like family.  We can be very tight knit, supporting one another in times of distress, whether it's professional or personal.  We celebrate triumph, commiserate with one another during defeat, and we mourn our losses as one. I am proud to work on my unit, and I call many of my colleagues friends.  I've not felt the same in previous roles, so I embrace it.","It would be dishonest of me to omit the flaws that I see (personally), so I'll outline them as best i can. 

As I mentioned, there is a sense of camaraderie and of family.  With that, though, comes the formation of cliques and aloof behavior.  It waxes and wanes, but it does happen.  Often, we are able to ""self-correct"", but sometimes it leads to alienation of new employees.  It's something of which we must all be mindful.  And like most families, we have our share of dysfunctional family members who are negative, loud, or downright cantankerous. We are but human.

Salary. I'm sure I've never met anyone who was completely satisfied with their compensation package. That said, I sometimes feel as if we aren't as competitive as we could be.  We as an organization set ourselves apart from other hospitals in most regards, but then choose to use local market comparisons for pay.  It seems counterintuitive if the objective is to recruit premier talent from across the country.  Adjusting for cost of living, we are still paid less than nurses at similar institutions with similar prestige (UCSF, Dana Farber, CHOP, and Stanford to name a few). 

Paid Time Off. As I previously stated, I feel like we have sufficient time off.  The con is that we continue to place time off in multiple buckets (sick, family sick and vacation).  My preference would be to see my current time off placed into a single PTO bucket, for use at my discretion.  While I'm sure there are those who use sick time on a consistent basis, I know a number of individuals who are no longer accruing sick time because they have reached the maximum allowed.  My concern is that other entities that have made the transition from Sick/Vacation route to PTO have decreased the overall benefit, and that would be detrimental. 

Limited advancement potential. While there are a number of roles away from the clinical area for nurses, there is limited upward potential within inpatient nursing.  Each unit has 6 coordinators, and there are only four manager roles.  It can be discouraging if you desire any sort of upward progression.  Couple that with poor to non-existent career guidance, and you have created an environment that encourages one to look outside the hospital for advancement.  

Shift differentials. A common complaint is the loss of shift differential for time off. If a dayshift employee takes time away from work (vacation/sick/personal time), then they are paid their normal salary.  A night shift employee who takes time away is ""penalized"" for taking time away, as the 20% night shift differential is not paid on unworked hours.   I'm also aware that the shift differential is intended to compensate employees for the hardships placed on shift workers who must adapt to unusual working hours.  My personal feeling is that it's equally difficult to ""flip-flop"" from a night to day circadian rhythm and that the hardship of shift work doesn't end just because I've chosen to take a day off.  I would also point out that it is not unprecedented.  The federal government currently pays shift workers differential for unworked hours, as do many state governments.  Additionally, there are entire industries that do as well.  

All that being said, none of the cons I've listed are deal breakers for me.  I only include the cons to illustrate both sides to the same coin."

That knowledge gives meaning and fulfillment to us all. 

At the head of our organization is Dr. James Downing, who constantly works to find new ways to connect with employees and families alike.

The recruiter was responsive to my questions and very informative with St. Jude information during the process.

After accepting the job offer and beginning employment, I've had several people ask me what it's like to work at St. Jude.  Their impression is that working at St. Jude would be depressing and very difficult.  While we do have very serious cases of childhood diseases being treated here, I can honestly say that St. Jude is a place of hope.  I feel much more hope in the corridors than I do depression.  Reality is different at St. Jude than any other employer where  I've worked.

St. Jude was INCREDIBLY helpful in assisting with the cross country transition and helping me get settled in Memphis. 

In my first few months of working here, St. Jude has completely lived up to (and in some cases exceeded) the expectations I had before starting here. As others have stated, they truly do seem to care about their employees and their input - which I think is often rare in a hospital/research setting. There is a feeling of a bigger mission and purpose within the institution, and for the most part, it is a mission that goes far beyond our individual pursuits and accomplishments.

704,St. Jude Children's Research Hospital,Desirable workplace if you are in the right job,2016-06-28,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"St. Jude is highly respected, both in the city of Memphis but throughout the United States as a whole. It feels good to work for an employer that is held in such high regard. The benefits are St. Jude are really pretty good – the 403b retirement plan (with 7% contribution by St. Jude!) and the medical, dental and vision benefits are also really nice too. The people here are generally nice and most of them are happy to be here. St. Jude is growing and is financially healthy, which bodes well for future employment and growth opportunities.","Unfortunately, like most employers, St. Jude has it’s flaws. In my particular position in Enterprise Informatics, I am the primary (well, really the only) resource in my area. If an issue arises, I pretty much have to respond to resolve the problem. Essentially, that makes me a resource that is on-call 24 hours a day, 7 days per week, 365 days per year. Of course, it really isn’t reasonable for someone to be on-call 24/7/365 but that is basically what it feels like and management has pretty much admitted that is the reality of my particular position. It was pretty disappointing to learn that being on-call all the time was the reality and the expectation of management, as that wasn’t mentioned in the job description when I applied and it wasn’t mentioned to me as a requirement of the job when I was interviewing for the position. This is a pretty big job requirement to somehow get left out of the job description and not get mentioned when interviewing candidates. How does it manage to get left out? A candidate should not find this out after accepting the job and beginning to work at St. Jude.

The biggest negative about being the only resource in my area (and being on-call 24/7/365 as a result) is that it makes it difficult to mentally separate myself from work, even after leaving St. Jude for the day. It leaves me wondering what I would do if I am out to eat with friends or family or at a movie theater and suddenly receive a call for help – will I be able to respond in a reasonable amount of time? What is actually a reasonable amount of time in my situation? Should I even go out to eat or to see a movie under these circumstances? Do I need to clear my plans with my boss before going? I certainly don’t want there to be an expectation that I have to clear my personal life & weekend plans with my boss, as that encroaches too much on an individual’s personal life to be reasonable. I haven’t been told that this is the case, of course, because no one in management has ever made it clear what the expectations are for responding to a call situation.

 I also have to think about it whenever I am considering traveling on weekends outside of my normal work hours. What happens if I receive a call while I am away? Will I be able to find a business, hotel, etc that has Wi-Fi? What if I am on the interstate or highway miles from any place with usable Wi-Fi? Again, do I need to clear my plans with my boss before going? What happens if I cannot respond for whatever reason (bad cell service, lack of WiFi access, etc.)? Will I be reprimanded? Will I be written up? Will I be fired? The expectations of management and of St. Jude as an organization have never really been clear in this regard. There are lots of little details like this that I am forced to think about because of the constant on-call aspect of my job, when I really should be free to focus on enjoying my life outside of work. Since there isn’t a clear separation between the two (work and personal life), it is sometimes difficult to enjoy my life outside of St. Jude.

While it would be true to say that I don’t receive a call every night or even every week but it is still a difficult position because no one can truly be available to respond to an issue all of the time. Life happens and sometimes people aren’t available. What happens when I cannot respond? I imagine that if I told my manager that I couldn’t respond, then he would try to deal with it himself (I have no true backup, so technically my manager would almost certainly be my backup). The problem with that idea is that he doesn’t truly know some of my work well enough to fix a lot of issues by himself. He would probably need my help resolving a decent percentage of system issues, which would mean me trying to walk him through resolving the problem over the phone. Of course, in that situation I might as well have taken the call and resolved the issue myself in the first place. So, relying on a backup person (ie, my manager) to provide me with some down time probably wouldn’t work out very well.

It is an unfortunate situation and I wish that there was a better solution that allowed me to truly be off duty on certain nights or weekends. I know an obvious suggestion that people might mention would be communicating with my supervisor on this particular issue but I am a little worried that this might cause some friction between myself and my manager if he senses that I am unhappy with this particular expectation of the job. I feel that it would be easier and clearer for everyone if there was a specific policy that covered this situation (ie the “always on-call staff”), as it shouldn’t be up to me to have to clear up confusion over a pretty important job requirement like this one.

To sum it up: St. Jude as a workplace as a whole would get 4 stars but I can only give 3 stars in my case because I feel that the 24/7/365 on-call expectation isn’t a realistic option, encroaches too much on personal life and should have been communicated clearly to me as a requirement of the position beforehand. 

 If I had truly known about the 24/7/365 on-call expectation beforehand, I would have requested significantly more money (either in the form of a large bump to my yearly salary or as on-call pay, something I currently do not receive) before ever accepting the job. I certainly wouldn’t do it for my present salary and wouldn’t do it for anything less than a six figure salary.

 I know HR does salary surveys for our positions but I highly doubt they are taking into account that some of our IT positions essentially require us to be on-call 24/7/365 whenever they are comparing our positions and salaries to the positions and salaries of other employers. As a result, the salary surveys in some of our cases are almost certainly an apples-to-oranges comparison.

If I leave St. Jude in the future it will almost certainly be because of the 24/7/365 on-call expectation and St. Jude’s lack of clarification on how we can respond to call requests and have work/life balance as well. Long-term, I have a feeling that is probably what I will do, so that I can set appropriate boundaries between work and personal life and so that I don’t have to be married to a cell phone and laptop every night and weekend."

The current CEO, Bill Evans, has brought many good changes to the hospital, he is a friendly, working-class type of man that is well-loved by everyone.

Opportunity to meet and work with people from different cultures.,"St.Jude does not reward excellence. Yearly salary increases are strictly within a meager range and no matter the quality of work done or the appreciation received, it is not rewarded with monetary rewards. 

It is especially frustrating when the performance review is excellent, but the pay raise is exactly the same as someone who has had unsatisfactory results.
Promotions also, as far as I could see, depends on seniority( how many years you have been at St.Jude) and not actual performance. Career growth is practically non existent. Management does not care to acknowledge or support the research staff here.

If you cannot negotiate a very good starting salary offer, do not accept a post here, because you will not be able to increase your pay later on the strength of good performance."

Administrators of the hospital management, from higher levels - CEO, CIO, CSO, PI level, and all of their wives, siblings, parents who hold management supervisory positions for good talented employees working under them at Stjude, DO NOT seem to care of this ""people institution - run by using our public money (not government money or their family money), other than they getting their fat salaries for their own benefits such as their retirement planning. 

Families and friends hired by them, during almost 5 - 30+ years out of normal legal ""hiring processes defined in labor department's laws for non-profit organizations"" need to be reviewed along with HR department's current and past leaderships, if suspected, at least during the past five years, who have been continuing abusing employees and their benefits and preventing them to be part of Stjude's success story.  

Most of the employees in management (manager level up) looks like running their own cult environment, disconnected from their top levels with their blessings, enjoying fat pay checks, claiming or showing they're exempt status privileged group so benefits are higher for them, which DO NOT based on their merit, education level, and skills - with so MANY  subordinates under them.

Management staff need to be picked up from junior staff by referendum and merit basis by an  advisory committee. 

Old Stjude management buddy style must be abolished soon before it's too late."
