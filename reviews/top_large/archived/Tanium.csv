- From your colleagues/peers to the CEO, everyone at Tanium is down to earth and laid back. Tanium hires heavy hitters, so they do not need micromanagement or heavy breathing. Everyone strives for excellence and integrity. We do the right thing and do the thing right.

- Suppose you are starting to feel stagnant and have skills that could be used elsewhere in the company. Tanium is more than willing to accommodate and keep you feeling fresh. 

- Way too many to list; get in or miss out.","You'll want to spend more time working because you enjoy it. (So, is it even work at that point?)"

16,Tanium,Best company I have ever worked for!,2022-02-18,5.0,Enterprise Services Engineer,The company takes care of its employees. I feel I have roles to grow my career in the way that best fits my needs.,If you don’t stay on top of technology you can easily become out of date like anything in the it tech industry.
17,Tanium,A mostly fine place to work,2022-02-24,4.0,Senior Software Engineer,"* Welcoming, friendly people

Phenomenal leadership
Best in business benefits
Incredible team dynamics",None. Any cons is from your own doing.
20,Tanium,Tanium has a great culture and phenomenal technology,2022-02-08,5.0,Enterprise Services Engineer,I really like the culture at Tanium and they have great pay/benefits. I believe that Tanium will go very very far.,The speed that Tanium creates new software and pushes out updates makes it very difficult to stay on top of the latest releases for software from Tanium. It isn't necessarily a bad thing but it certainly means you can fall behind quickly if you aren't good at managing your time.
21,Tanium,Great Culture & Easy to Get Things Done,2022-01-28,5.0,Senior Manager of Executive Engagement,"- Our Chairman and CEO, David and Orion Hindawi (father & son) are the co-founders. Not only do they deeply understand the product, but they truly care about its excellent quality and value for our customers.
- 99% of the people I work with at Tanium are intelligent, hardworking, kind, and easy to work with.
- They pay better than the other two tech companies I've worked at, prior
- Right now (pandemic), most of the workforce is 100% WFH except for rare onsite events or annual planning weeks.
- Things just get done here. Everyone is helpful.
- Potential IPO in the next few years, but even if we stay private, the company does optional stock/RSU buyback events where you can sell a small portion of your vested private stock back to the company for cash.
- If you work hard and are open to growth, there really are a ton of growth opportunities, just scan LinkedIn for people who have been here for years. Great people get promoted quickly, regardless of age or years of experience. You are rewarded for your ability and the work you put in.","- Most teams have to work overtime, but I doubt that's any different than any other tech startups
- If you like in-person work at the office, most of the company works from home now
- IPO is still uncertain, but again, no different than most tech startups"
22,Tanium,Great Place To Work,2022-02-01,5.0,Technical Writer,"Tanium is one of the best companies I have ever worked for. The culture is amazing. The mantra of ""One Team One Fight"" is alive and well here. Work-life balance is great, and compensation I would say is above average. Just a great place to work all the way around.","Tanium issues all of its employees MacBooks, which I am not a fan of for an office type environment like ours. Had to set up a VM environment to run some of our productivity tools native to Windows."
23,Tanium,Respected and valued - this is how it should be everywhere!,2022-01-25,5.0,Associate Technical Account Manager,"I am continually impressed by how well myself and my colleagues are treated at Tanium. At my former company, I was used to upper leadership pushing back on change and employee feedback falling on deaf ears. Here, leadership proactively makes decisions that benefit us without us even needing to ask for it! For example: announcing our annual bonus would be absorbed into base salary, and encouraging us to expense meals if working through lunch or into the evenings when the Log4j vulnerability hit. That is on top of the already generous compensation and benefits. I am trusted to do my work well in the ways that work best for me and my customers. I have a lot of autonomy and flexibility in how, when, and where I do my work. I don't waste time on a lot of meetings or random standardized tasks (like everyone needs to do XYZ with their customer), which helps me have a better work-life balance and spend my time on more interesting work. I typically work around 40h a week and am encouraged to leverage the unlimited vacation policy. The team is great - lots of smart people with diverse career backgrounds always jumping in and help each other. I've enjoyed getting to learn about a lot of different areas within IT and expand my skillset. All in all, I am consistently valued and respected here and am thankful to be a part of the team.","Nothing egregious, but a heightened day-to-day focus on diversity and inclusion would be beneficial as we continue to grow and increase diversity on the team. We have received education and I am confident everyone is well-intentioned, just perhaps need a bit more practice and awareness."
24,Tanium,So far so good 😊,2022-01-27,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"I’ve been with Tanium for approximately 6 months. The onboarding process was smooth. Compensation is very competitive. Work/life balance is a real thing here. Tons of support to be successful. Overall, it has been a great experience.",I don’t have any cons at this time.

31,Tanium,Unstoppable and solving the industry's challenge problems,2022-01-21,5.0,"Senior Director, Finance","Career opportunities are unlimited and you get what you put in. Culture is inclusive and flat organization structure enables decision making outside of executive leadership. Clear vision from senior management promotes an unified effort across functions on solving the unsolvable problems in the cybersecurity and IT management industry. Culture allows for the choice of work life balance, while compensation/benefits is competitive compared to major tech companies.","Tanium isn't a household name yet, but someday it will be!"

36,Tanium,Fantastic Company!,2022-01-20,5.0,Technical Account Manager,"Tanium is a fantastic place to work! The product is great and the company is headed in an awesome direction. The company culture is fantastic, and employees fully embrace and live up to the mantra of ""one team one fight"" and ""we do the right thing"".","As a Windows heavy user, Tanium (company) issues Macs so it was a bit of an adjustment to be highly productive. Microsoft Outlook on Mac is a step back in productivity as compared to Outlook on Windows. It would be great if they could support both platforms equally as I have to use a Windows PC to support customers. Overall, this is a very small con, and it's really the only thing that came to mind."
37,Tanium,Great Culture & People! Best place I have worked!,2022-01-20,5.0,Senior Sales Operations Analyst,"I've never worked at a place where every person you come into contact with is super nice and wants to help out. The remote working works very well and things get done effectively. The work-life balance is also a big perk, everyone works hard while they are on, but leadership makes sure you are not burnt out. The pay is pretty good as well. Leadership is great and will be open to what you have to say (even at an intern level).","- levels - There is starting to become to many levels - cant get heard sometimes because of this.
- Career development/progression - so far, there hasn't been much talk about how I can progress in my role and move up.
- Offsites - I have not met anyone in person. I think it is very important to have at least one offsite each QTR to build relationships with your team. Especially since the company isn't paying for offices.
- vision - I would say leadership needs to talk more about where we are going and what we are trying to do in the future. Keeps people motivated knowing they are working towards big things ahead."

40,Tanium,Excellent Culture!,2022-01-18,5.0,Enterprise Services Engineer,"I couldn't have asked for a more supportive and rewarding company to be a part of, this coming from someone who spent ten years in the military culture of one team cohesion. 

Tanium prides itself 100% on supporting their employees, whether it be from the leadership or peers. At no point have I felt a lack of knowledge simply because there are either people willing to readily help or resources readily available to supplement the information. The fact that I can wake up eager to work everyday is the best feeling I could ask for.","Remote working can sometimes cause a feeling of detachment if you're used to working in an office, but that's with any remote job."

Current CRO (as of Dec '21) is a reflection of Orion's disregard for the go to market organization.

Because it is a more midsized company compared to the typically massive tech corporation, the community feels tighter and feels more like a work family than a web of coworkers. People are super supportive and helpful, and your voice can be heard if you make your opinion known. Especially during this Covid moment, the company has been relentless in keeping the health and well-being of its employees at the forefront of all of its policies, which I highly respect. The CEO has a vision of making Tanium a great business that sells great software and his passion for excellence is contagious.","The onboarding experience was not optimal: broken links, conflicting information, and unrelated trainings.

74,Tanium,Freedom to innovate,2021-10-09,5.0,Enterprise Services Systems Integration Engineer,"Tanium encourages innovation and expresses this desire with their action towards their employees. They will give you the tools needed to make the product better and aid your development (Ex: Home server). 

Pros:
 - Full Remote
 - Competitive Pay
 - Lack of unneeded ""red tape""
 - Positive work environment","The type of individuals that work at Tanium are self motivated. If there is down time everyone is using that time to better the product/company is some way. If you are a person that does better with a structured work environment (Ex: Boss gives you a lists of tasks to do) you may find it hard to work here. However, if you are someone that likes the freedom to create solutions this environment is amazing."

76,Tanium,"Benefits are great, moral- not so much",2021-09-22,3.0,Senior Software Engineer,"The people are awesome. It's impressive how people come together and believe in the one team, one fight mantra. The benefits are amazing. This could have easily been one of the best jobs I've ever had.","The CEO flip-flops constantly on what he considers important to focus. For example, Tanium was poised to take over the security space, they had even hired a bunch of subject matter experts, but then it was decided that the direction was going to go in a totally different direction. 

There is also a fear of getting on the CEO's bad side for fear of retaliation. 

Some of the higher ups try to make you feel bad for expenses incurred during mandatory company get-togethers. I've never been at a place that treats you like a child with respect to expenses. There are of course limits, and rightfully so, but to make you feel bad because you almost got to that limit or you didn't car share because there wasn't going to be someone at the airport for another 2 hours after your flight arrived is ludicrous. For a company that's doing well, it seems strange to try to make you feel grateful for them allowing you to expense something.

The hiring process is painful. It takes forever to hire people and the really good ones often get tired of the process and leave the pipeline before they can complete it."

Very good training (although long) to get new employees quickly up-to-speed on products.
Most people were easy to work with.","Internal processes are horrible.
Executives are clueless. 
Company grew way too quickly, adding a large number of new employees only to have layoffs follow. Poor planning on that front.
Many talented people started leaving.
Poor severance package that doesn't meet industry standards."

- The 1-Team-1-Fight culture isn't lip service...It's legitimately the way everyone conducts themselves, and enables you to do the best work of your career
- Everyone is brilliant here, but the ego's aren't prevalent or even tolerated
- They make you feel welcome and empowered from day ONE
- Strong work/life balance attitude (you just have to have self control to know when you need to step away)","- Super fast paced (is to be expected for a unicorn startup)
- You WILL feel imposter syndrome; which goes to show how they only hire top-tier talent. But if you get past the interviews and hired on..you deserve to be here; so don't lose sight of that"
85,Tanium,Great focus on customers,2021-09-17,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Very focused on supporting customers and delivering exceptional customer service. Leadership is open and willing to listen / adapt,Difficult to meet team members all the time due to remote status
86,Tanium,9 Months in and love this company even more,2021-09-16,5.0,Technical Solutions Engineer,The team members here have always been there when I had a question or needed some guidance. 1 Team 1 Fight is demonstrated here everyday. I have been given opportunities to contribute in ways I was never offered at previous companies.,Typical growing pains of a maturing company. While challenging at times it does give you the opportunity to grow and expand your impact.
87,Tanium,"Dysfunction be thy name. Change motto to ""One team MANY FIGHTS.""",2021-10-08,1.0,GTM,"Remote work, market comp, decent benefits.","1) Dysfunction defines Tanium. The product, vision, marketing and sales teams are all out of sync. 

2) The CEO rules the company by diktat. Failure to do what they want means ouster. They are not open to feedback and do not listen to experts in their domains . 

3) The executive team has no say. Leaders hired for their expertise from seasoned massive companies, come here and lose their voice. 

4) Tanium is STILL trying to consolidate security+management. Late to the cloud game, tough story to tell, and CEO's view of the industry is out of touch with reality. 

5) Toxic workplace environment. ""One Team One Fight"" is the motto, but in practice it is ""ONE TEAM MANY FIGHTS"". The level of politics , getting to CEO's ear, that exists at Tanium for its size is crazy. You do not have 100,000 employees to have this level of politics. You have barely 2500. 



6) If you are not a TAM/Engineer, you are replaceable. If you are not a TAM/Engineer, you work in a cut-throat environment. Think twice before considering a non-TAM/Engineering opportunity at Tanium. THINK TWICE. 

Never a week goes by without a negative news story coming out. 



I do not see the fundamentals either in leadership, culture or business for it to become a mature , public company unless drastic changes are made."
88,Tanium,Challenging and Rewarding!,2021-09-10,5.0,Enterprise Services Engineer,"The people that work here are amazing! The Tanium team lives up to our values and fosters a very productive culture. We win as a team. We recognize the exceptional work and celebrate our teams wins. Bonuses are tied to company performance as a whole. Nobody shrugs off problems they are not responsible for. They bend over backwards to do what's right, regardless of their job title. Nobody micro-manages me, I don't punch a time clock, I don't have a paid time off limit, and I'm regularly encouraged to work on a healthy work/life balance. This unique autonomy and purpose makes Tanium unstoppable!","Tanium only hires the most extraordinary people. I had 5 interviews, with 9+ people, which took over 2 months. Every new hire resume crosses the CEO's desk. If you're fortunate enough to join our team it can be intimidating. You'll often hear this referred to as ""Imposter Syndrome"". There's so much to learn and everyone here sets such a high bar, it can be overwhelming. It a humbling experience to realize that you were chosen deliberately to be here. These are only ""cons"" for those who are lazy, or don't understand the value of humility and a challenge."

For the most part all managers are really helpful and want you to succeed. The team is full of bright and talented people. Quick vertical movement if you’re good.,There’s a lot of changes happening at Tanium and that results I’m many systems and procedures changing. It can be frustrating trying to get comfortable if you aren’t experienced. Quota is often missed amongst the entire organization and that’s due the quota being unreasonable for the times we are in. They are looking at reevaluating that so that’s nice. Taking this job you need to be prepared to call and speak to a lot of different people many of who don’t want to speak with you. If you can’t do that this isn’t the role for you.

- excellent product
- surrounded by some of the best expertise from whom one can learn
- collaborative and supportive colleagues","- founders (ceo and chairman) have absolute and dictatorial control, which leads to poor decisions and high inefficiency across all Commercial functions.
- people are scared of the CEO and his reactions, which leads to a dysfunctional culture. VP and below culture is good, but above that it is poor and corrosive.
- Churn in Commercial leadership roles (Finance, Marketing, Sales) is for a good reason. CEO does not understand GTM and drives out high-performing experts due to his tops-down leadership style that does not build trust in his ELT
- Above issues are classic of a private company, led by the founder/ceo that is technically brilliant but thinks it's his way or the highway. This works when you have 500 people and are private but not when you have 2000 and heading towards a potential IPO."

In hindsight, there's definitely a reason for that one year cadence, see cons.","I have never seen that much turnover. No CMO has lasted more than two years. Four Marketing leaders left before or their one year mark. And even at the manager level and below a lot of people leave within months of joining. Why? Mostly because of the toxic environment the few remaining leaders create. Plus, they micromanage you and promise you career growth just to turn around and take it all back. It's hard to write such a negative review for a former employer but I and others are so glad we got out of there."
104,Tanium,Amazing Culture and People: Special Place to Work,2021-08-06,5.0,Global Head of Enablement,"After one year at Tanium I have to say this is the best culture of any company I have ever worked for. Engagement scores are off the chart and routinely voted best place to work and it is real. No politics here just a team working together to do great things with great products and in a fast growing marketing which is cyber security, IT operations and risk management. This is special place and honestly our goal is to add people with the same vision and values we have as we don't want to lose the great culture here.",No special downsides.

I learn, I teach and so much more. 

Let's talk it out though:

Great Benefits
Great Compensation
Great Vacation Policy","You can get super busy if you don't manage yourself properly and it's easy to do. There's some what a struggle with finding time to do it all but only you can manage that balance. What does it look like to go from a small company to a medium sized conglomerate?

The product is exceptional, a truly differentiated platform, many happy customers and the support is excellent.","It's an engineering-led company so sometimes decision-making can be a bit deliberate, but that has minimized over time. There is good structure and process for most things, but sometimes that can bog down resolution."

The story never changes and you feel like you are on repeat daily vs. learning and growing. 

The Hindawi's keep promising an IPO which is never going to happen... so it's a lie and those employees that are counting on their equity to become something of value are going to continue to be disappointed. 

Tanium & Orion like to tell you they are the leader in this space, their IP is superior to any of their competitors. In some ways it is; but mostly the promised functionality to customers is never fulfilled. As the US was rocked by the cyber attacks on the Grid and Meat production sectors, you never heard Tanium's name in the mix.... and I believe that will continue to be the case as time goes on."

The leadership team is great and truly wants what is best for you as an individual. It is truly an incredible how my boss and leaders above her enable me to do what I am passionate about, and help me to learn and grow in my role.

115,Tanium,"Incredible product, amazing team, good culture",2021-07-16,5.0,Associate Technical Account Manager,"Team-oriented and process-driven. For TAMs, the product is groundbreaking; easy to be excited about. We've seen what the product can do and know how it works, so the energy and passion that goes into supporting customers is genuine. This has made the job of facing customers MUCH easier. 

C-Suite is standing at the head of a rapidly growing and changing organization, but they have adequately opened lines of communication with the rank-and-file and made a ton of effort to promote a sense of community. Organizational and middle managers (at least on the TAM side) have been promoted from within, so they understand the challenges of the job. Every one I have met have been mentors to me in some way. This has been a tremendous benefit. Everywhere I look, I see role models.","Navigating the organization and knowing who to turn to for help can be pretty daunting, especially when working from home. There's been a lot of organizational change this year as the company has grown, and keeping up can be challenging.

Not a con, but the workday really benefits from self-discipline. As a TAM, you have quite a bit of freedom to set your own schedule. This can backfire, to the point that you spend too many or too few hours working."

Our technology continues to grow to stay ahead of the competition and our focus is customer first.","While we have a growing marketing engine and the team does a lot to promote brand recognition, our broad offering sometimes leaves us in a category of our own which hasn't allowed us to be ""best of breed"" in a specific Gartner Quadrant."

You can really expand your skills and experience horizon here",For a pre-ipo company the company is fairly lethargic. People won't get in your way or stop you but there doesn't seem to be much energy or excitement here. Probably because company has been around for awhile and has a mix of old timers and people hired in from large corporations.
130,Tanium,Witty but appropriate review title,2021-06-09,5.0,Director of Technical Account Management,"* The Culture of respect - Tanium hires adults and treats their employees like adults, and values their time and efforts. They select for self-managing individuals. And those individuals include luminaries in the field with decades of expertise and an inability to ignore a call for help; should you happen across a problem you can't solve, chances are somebody knows what to do (or literally wrote the book on that)

* The Technology - Tanium does things in a way that nobody else can. While the product has its rough edges, the technology is versatile and flexible to the point that I'm not honestly sure how I'd run a comprehensive Operations and Security program

* The Company and the Customers - You don't leave Tanium because you want to work with bigger, more important organizations, they're already here. Tanium's customer list would justify its valuation alone at a typical startup, and yet the company is also profitable. Tanium is helping some of the largest organizations in the world accomplish their strategic objectives, and is positioned to do so long term. Unlike many tech companies, I can see my self sticking around for the long haul too.","* All Remote - Tanium has a relatively small physical footprint in a few select cites across the States, thus most employees work remotely 100% of the time. For me this is no issue, but does mean we rely significantly on digital communication and your ability to self-manage.

* By Engineers for Engineers - It is clear this is a company built by engineers for engineers. It allows for an incredible amount of innovation and flexibility in terms of the technical solutions the company delivers, but expertise is often assumed. It's a known issue, and is something they're working on across the board.

* Nobody will know where you work (maybe that's a positive?). I've only met one person who knew what I was talking about when I mentioned where I work, and that was because they drove past the corporate office on their commute. If you're looking for the nerd cred of working for a FANG, you won't get that here."

Great technology that can always improve and continues to do so. Strong channel program that is likely one of the best in the industry at this point. 

This is a place where we walk in our core values every day - We Do The Right Thing, We Win As A Team, and We Are Unstoppable. If you believe in those values and want an opportunity to thrive and help us grow, this is the place for you!","From a sales perspective, this is not for the faint of heart. We have a strong value proposition, but we must tie it directly to the business value within an organization. That takes selling, not quoting! 

From a company perspective, there are always areas to improve and Tanium is no stranger to that. But, I have seen us grow exponentially in order to respond to the market and customer requirements right along with our channel partners. We are a company not afraid to adjust our strategy should it need to be course corrected."
133,Tanium,Great Technology and leadership,2021-06-04,5.0,Director of Strategic Accounts,"Great platform, great pay and benefits!",Challenging times to sell new logos
134,Tanium,Awesome company and leadership,2021-05-28,5.0,Sales Executive,Unbelievable assistance available from all levels. Easy access to executives as needed. Fabulous products that work as advertised. Tremendous support. High renewal rates tell quite a positive story. Look at the top logos running Tanium solutions. Very impressive.,I cannot think of anything at the moment
135,Tanium,"Amazing culture, standard-setting product, great people",2021-05-25,5.0,Strategic Consultant,Teamwork at Tanium is unlike anything I've experienced (in the best way possible),Deeply technical product that does require some dedicated study
136,Tanium,This place rocks,2021-05-18,5.0,Technical Account Manager,Incredible team. Great product. Amazing culture and dedication to the mission. All the good parts of a cult (e.g. bonding and acceptance) without the bad parts.,"Over the years the team dynamics have changed a good bit (it's a small company that grew extremely fast). It's no longer the same small company it was. So if you are looking for a tech start up that has no rules or process, then sadly this isn't it."
137,Tanium,Culture + New Hire Training,2021-05-17,5.0,Sales Development Representative (SDR),"This culture is absolutely amazing. After meeting my colleagues, I actually for once in my life, feel like I really was vetted for this position. The caliber of individuals here is second to none. Everyone is thirsty to learn more and help out where they can.","After completing New Hire Training, I felt that it was geared more towards engineer/technical side of things. Some of the material was no applicable to my direct day to day tasks as an SDR that I need to complete in order to hit quota."
138,Tanium,Great first year,2021-05-19,5.0,Director of Strategic Accounts,"Incredible technology, people and feedback loop to improve things. As a seller, I didn't feel like a number but instead we worked together to advance the Tanium campaigns we endeavored.","young company, still figuring out downstream segmentation"
139,Tanium,A big company that feels small,2021-05-18,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"The culture here is excellent. The company has around 1500 people, but doesn't have the bureaucracy and politics that I've seen at every other company of that size.","Sorry, I don't have any."
140,Tanium,One of the best teams I've ever worked with,2021-05-18,5.0,Senior Product Marketing Manager,Everyone here is really talented and also easy to work with. I'm also amazed at how responsive people are and almost never require follow up. Managers also really try hard to listen and take the feedback. It feels like Tanium got dinged on this recently and they know they have to improve so they're making an effort.,It's really fast paced and there's a lot of catch up work being done. Don't come here if you're expecting to coast or likely take on more work as various people leave.
141,Tanium,Best career move I ever made was coming here,2021-05-11,5.0,Global Technology,"Challenging workplace. Hires world-class professionals that are all experts in their domains. No fiefdoms, work is very team-based/coop. Extreme ownership in customer service and technical challenges. Hotbed for innovation and self-growth.

Good benefits, management chain that cares about people enough to not burn them out. Customers are great, dev team is rock solid. No complaints here.

Best company I have worked at in my 26 year career, including being self-employed for 4 years. Great referral program.","Easy to take on too much if you don't know your limits and have self-discipline. Work is a lot of fun so it's easy to get sucked in afterhours on special individual projects.

Really that's the con, the work is fun enough you enjoy it :)

Some people need new titles/career advancement, this place is pretty flat organizationally. I'm 3 steps from CEO who has an open door policy. If you need a new title every couple years you'll feel like you aren't progressing here maybe.

I find if you are comfortable in your career on what you know, what you want to learn and who you want to be, you can grow a lot here though professionally. Just the title doesn't change."
142,Tanium,Awesome Culture,2021-05-14,5.0,Director of Global Accounts,"Dynamic, Ambitious, Inclusive, Remunerate well, Phenomenal Culture, People are the best in their field",I don't really have anything to say here. I haven't seen any downside.
143,Tanium,Don’t Do It,2021-06-10,1.0,Project Manager,"Nice, hardworking, and smart people doing all the grunt work. Decent benefits.","Lack of transparency in all things. Raises are almost non-existent. It’s one thing to work hard in a start up environment (it’s expected) but it’s insane inefficiency that is maddening and the startup mentality excuse is not the root cause. It actually behaves like an old, slow moving company. The company is the most political ever witnessed, which is hugely ironic because a core value is allegedly “we reject corporate politics.” The “we might IPO” carrot is played out and people are leaving by the masses.
The technology itself is good but carries a lot of tech debt and others are cheaper and improving faster in this space."
144,Tanium,Tanium Review,2021-05-10,5.0,Senior DSA,"Great people, Great Technology and a developing strategy with partners and channel that are going to be key to success moving forward.",Tanium hasn't marketed themselves very well in the Public space. Would like to see more advertising and marketing to the general public on successes and exciting technology and tools that make this company great.
145,Tanium,No longer a company I recognize,2021-04-11,2.0,Non-Technical Role,"Colleagues are oftentimes great people to work with
Decent benefits/compensation
Work remotely from anywhere
Certain managers are exceptional","Politics - For a company of approximately 1,700 employees, the politics here are now exceptionally vicious. This wasn't always the case, but it's become increasingly toxic since David Hindawi receded from the limelight with his son at the helm. Tanium has more yes-men now more than ever and increasingly so. Don't even bother reporting anything to HR. They are there to protect the executive team and no amount of documentation will change the outcome.

Culture - Tanium used to believe in and act inline with their cultural pillars (win as a team, do the right thing, we are unstoppable). It is now:
1. The only people who matter are in leadership, everyone else is disposable 
2. Integrity is optional
3. Eliminate anyone who stands in your way 
For a company that was under fire for poor cultural practices in 2017, it has become apparent they did not learn from their mistakes. Tanium regressed back into old habits which was made painstakingly obvious with the claw backs recently in October 2020. It is clear that Orion Hindawi will never be his father. 

Though it is not as compelling as my first two points, Tanium is stingy - We didn't have any holiday fun or activities during the great pandemic of 2020. Friends at other equivalent companies held events in lieu of a holiday party. Employees at other companies also got larger bonuses since they didn't have catered lunches anymore or a monthly stipend. This was not the case at Tanium.

If you really want to know more about Tanium's history of bad behavior, google it."
146,Tanium,Could have been better,2021-05-06,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"- excellent/smart employees
- great pay
- great bonus
- potentially exciting work
- great position in the market","- the ship seems to have to no/limited direction.
- the realignment has many getting put on jobs they didn't hire in for, nor have a desire to be limited to. (went from full stack to 1 thing)
- no longer have any input in the design of the software.
- the potentially exciting work is based on if your in the in crowd.
- cliques. They will tell you that politics are a thing, and I'd say years ago I'd believe it, but with realignment and everyone clawing to get to the top it doesn't feel good.

writing off the cons as ""fast paced"" is likely. It is or can be, but when you're fast paced because of repeated poor decisions and last minute busting butt to get out a poorly designed feature, that's not ""fast paced"", that's poor management."
147,Tanium,Great Place to Work,2021-05-07,5.0,Senior Contract Manager,Great new hire training.

The culture here is great and the people are wonderful. I started right before the pandemic and was very nervous how things would go. But Tanium has done an awesome job at making sure they continue build a great place to work while navigating the pivot to wfh and ensuring that their people are taken care of. The leadership team does an excellent job of communicating. There is strong encouragement to keep a healthy work life balance and everyone pitches in to help make that happen when they can. Of course things aren't always ways peachy, but the good out ways the bad.","As the company grows, there are lots of changes that are happening. Sometimes the transitions aren't as smooth as they could be."

The people are amazing.

The technology is amazing.

There is no shortage of opportunities for career growth if you are willing to put in the effort.",Working at Tanium can be incredibly stressful. The company is run lean and there is never a lack of work to be done. It takes a very specific type of person to thrive here.
156,Tanium,Best Career Move I've Made,2021-04-21,5.0,Associate Technical Account Manager,"Tanium is hands down the best company I've ever worked for and the best company I've ever heard of in terms of culture. Here at Tanium we are a family. We win together. You hear amazing things about our culture when you read about our company and go through the interview process, and it sounds too good to be true. I promise you it is not. Working here has allowed me to bring my whole self to work, to foster my creativity, to build confidence in my technical and soft skills, and to feel fulfilled in my career. We have an amazing group of people building/supporting/selling an amazing product. Tanium is a unicorn company, and I'm so proud to work here.","We move FAST.

164,Tanium,Best Onboarding Experience Ever,2021-03-26,5.0,Technical Solutions Engineer,"Tanium values their employees and that's evident from the very first day. They construct an onboarding program (NHT - New Hire Training) that is specific to your job and duties. Although it is very rigorous, most of what they are teaching has been fine tuned and is specific to what you need to know to do your job effectively. I've worked from some BIG names in the tech industry and the NHT/onboarding from these companies was nowhere close to what Tanium provides. The culture and communication, internal to Tanium, is top notch. From day one, I have felt as if I have became part of something special. Tanium's philosophies are centered on ethics and ""Doing the right thing..."" Many times, after my first day, I was told ""You made it through the interview. You belong here"". That statement could not be more true because the Tanium interview process rates very high in terms of thoroughness and difficulty. But, once you get past the interview and start, you are welcomed with open arms, genuine smiles, by some very smart opened mined people and given everything you need to be successful. The people here are genuinely happy and I really do feel as if I can reach out to anyone if I need assistance, especially when it comes to managing an account. Since I've been here their has been a lot of emphasis on not doing anything alone. This is evident when you join customer calls because all the teams involved want to see you succeed as much as they want to successful themselves. In short, everything about Tanium that I've experienced so far is 5 STARTS!!!","Very rigorous and challenging interview process. For the TSE position, I think I had at least 5 interviews, including a panel interview and 45 minute presentation."

It makes me sad to have to give this feedback, but it is the greatest gift I can give them is the truth of my experience.","The worst sales leadership and micromanagement you could ever imagine. The Enterprise South East Sales Leadership has literally had almost the whole team leave over the last 8 months. The company has had every feedback on the issue from every aspect of the company, but it appears the Sales leadership won't address it. When is too late?"

This is to be expected with a company growing so fast."
168,Tanium,Hands Down Great Company,2021-03-18,5.0,Technical Solutions Engineer,"Never worked anywhere that has the sense of collaboration and teamwork that Tanium does. Lots of companies have catchy slogans, mission statements, etc., but the words are often hollow. Read the ""Careers"" and ""About"" pages on the Tanium site. The company leadership and its employees live everything written there every single day. It's a privilege to be a part of something so special.","There is a steep learning curve, but that's not a bad thing. If you want to be here, you'll welcome the challenge."

They're killing it financially.,"Management is seriously immature. If you have issues, you're on your own. ""One Team One Fight"" is a common mantra, but is pretty ethereal in practice if you're not one of the favored few. No company pays like Tanium if they don't have to. You should ask yourself why they do."

-The company culture, morals, values, mindset, and leadership are all solid.  Everyone is team oriented, do their job well, are mission focused, and motivated everyday.  Leadership does not put up barriers or walls - they truly embody our mantra of “one team, one fight”.  They will without hesitation “get their hands dirty” in order to make our company or the company successful. 
-Technical resources, training, onboarding, ongoing training opportunities is awesome and well structured.
-A lot of incredibly smart people here!
-Unlimited PTO w/o the shame game!
-Competitive comp packages","-work/life balance......
-The Product is complex.  There are 15 modules.  The learning curve is STEEP!
-The TAM role is probably the most demanding, pressure filled, high expectation role at Tanium.  While there have been recent changes that are meant to off-load some duties, that will likely take a few more years to fully surface.  Currently, the TAM is responsible for some PreSales, Technical Support, ProServices, Training, and Product Testing/QA.  With that, that makes the first point listed above even more true!  Being dedicated tech support to a handful of accounts is a time suck and a daily grind.  Burn out is very real here! 
Unless you’ve been here for 3+ years already and know the product intimately, expect a rough ride for the first 12 months atleast.

- I feel respected. Tanium respects me, and I respect Tanium. 
- Work environment. Team spirit and a sense of community is highly encouraged. ""No Stupid Questions"" isn't just a saying.
- Compensation package is excellent. 
- Equality and inclusion. I'm not just talking about social and ethical principals, which are top tier. I'm also referring to the ability for anyone in the company to get involved anywhere else in the company. Anyone is always welcome to get involved anywhere else. Which brings me to: 
- Advancement. You're a TAM and want to get involved in Sales? Go for it. In Sales right now and want to be a dev? We'll even train you. As long as it fits in with the needs of the company (i.e. you're not abandoning a customer contract) you can do anything you want here -- just put in the work and make your desires known to the org and it'll happen.

The platform has unrivaled capabilities and is continuing to grow with the help of everyone in the company. Tanium leadership shows a deep appreciation for their employees and regularly do their part to ensure that everyone is taken care of, both in their work life and their personal life.","Imposter syndrome can be a very real feeling for the first few months - that is not unexpected when working with such a talented group of individuals - but it is something that can be overcome easily if you understand that you are here for a reason, just like everyone else. The 401k matching can continue to be improved as it has been in the last couple of years. You can easily find yourself overwhelmed from time to time, whether it's from needs of the customer or needs of the company. You sometimes have to be very proactive in stepping away from your desk in order to recharge your batteries, but even then it can sometimes feel like the company is continuing to drive down the road at 100mph without you."

The sales force is still prominently white males (such is tech sales) - but the company is working on it, and the sales folks are all very kind and respectful."
216,Tanium,What a great place to work!!!,2020-11-12,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Tanium is an incredible company. When I was interviewing here a year ago, I knew that our technology and our financial standing was solid - and that stability could not have been more important in this last year.

A year later, and I am amazed at the opportunities that I have had to grow and succeed here. Tanium truly embodies it's values, and empowers employees to do some of the best work of their careers!","Definitely want to see the company continue to strive for DEI initiatives, which have been a huge priority for our leadership team."
217,Tanium,"Great place to work, especially if you are wanting to push yourself to grow.",2020-10-27,5.0,senior director of technical account management,"A company with an amazing collaborative culture, great compensation, and built around a revolutionary technology, with a key focus on empathy (internal and external) and pushing boundaries. The company offers a large amount of flexibility to it's employee's, be that adjusting schedules to better load balance your work and life. Giving you freedom to engage in special (passion) projects and interests that improve the lives of our customers and employees. Similarly, allowed time allocation for investment into our local communities.

The employee base largely consists of ""smartest person in the room"" figures from all over multiple industries, leaving a wealth of accessible knowledge to all new comers to the organization. I do want to be clear though, that even with a laundry list of bragging rights that a lot of our employees have, in my time here, I've never observed anyone lording that over others and quite frankly, it wouldn't be tolerated. 

Humility, intelligence, teamwork, empathy, and passionate tend to be the most common attributes of the average Tanium employee. 

We aim to do the right thing, even if it's hard.

Finally, our leadership team. That may be weird to read, but it's true. I cannot count the number of times as we've grown, I've seen things introduced that smack of some necessary process that we've all seen poorly executed in our previous careers. When that occurs a lot of us reflexively respond negatively (growing pains, we're human too). In and through all of that, I've never seen David or Orion let any of those changes happen at a cost to the employee or culture (even if that meant they personally took the hit, or in a few cases took the decision back to rework it). This is not limited to just David and Orion, but to the entirety of our leadership team. 

You will be valued and protected to the best of their ability, and I know that through years of personal experience here, and that's not merely reserved for a select few either.","Tanium is growing, and with that comes growing pains; couple that with market demand that has at times placed us in a leaner state than I would be prefer.

Freedom coupled with driven intelligent people often means individual over-extension. This is less of a Tanium problem, and more of an issue with self governance and time management, but are the only real cons I can think of."
218,Tanium,Amazing! One Team One Fight,2020-11-02,5.0,Associate Technical Account Manager,"Loving Tanium so far! The people here are truly passionate about this company. Tanium is much different than the large organizations I have come from - I feel like a member of the family instead of a number on a page. 

The training here is superb. All new hires are enrolled in a two-month, comprehensive training program where we are given all of the tools and information we need to learn the technology and value proposition of Tanium.

Speaking of technology - Tanium is an extraordinarily capable tool that is taking off, and I see Tanium being successful long into the future.

Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, Tanium has continued to grow (by personnel and revenue). We are ramping up to have our best quarter ever in Q4 2020.

Tanium has fantastic compensation and benefits. I received an offer that would have been extremely difficult to turn down.","Unknown future of the company - could be purchased, could IPO, could stay private. Not necessarily a con, just something to consider."
219,Tanium,Great place to work remote,2020-10-21,5.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Good compensation package, the bonus plan is generous and has consistently paid out. Tanium definitely tries to be on the forefront with its benefits package and seems genuinely invested in employees' wellbeing. Interesting products to work on. Exciting plans for the future. Feel connected to company success and growth. Fellow engineers are extremely knowledgable and always willing to help. Tanium being primarily remote before the pandemic meant adjusting to remote life changes was fairly seamless. Felt well supported as a remote employee even before the pandemic.","The focus on continuously delivering new tooling for customers means that there can be a large tech debt burden, and lack of thorough testing though there are clear plans in place to fix both. There is a semi-implicit expectation of working late to get the job done. Tanium has shown it isn't afraid to let go of employees that don't meet their expectations, which can be both good and bad. It's nice not having a coworker that doesn't pull their weight, but also can feel like your job isn't always secure."

I was fired without warning or cause just a few weeks before my first vesting. At termination I was told that Tanium “wanted to help me” by paying my minimum bonus and granting the pending vesting shares. (It also happens that this type of ‘help’ makes it more difficult to mount a successful wrongful termination case.)

Seven months after their 'help,' Tanium exercised a right to repurchase those same RSUs — stripping me of the equity I built into the company.

^ All legal. Not what I would call ""Do the right thing."" (All the Tanium 'values.')

246,Tanium,Know what you're getting into,2020-08-07,3.0,"Director, Technical Account Management","- Incredible technology that the employees actually believe in.

- You're given full autonomy to do the right thing for the customer.

- You'll work with some of the smartest and most dedicated people that you've ever met.","- If you already have bad work boundaries and an unhealthy work-life balance, Tanium is not a good choice. Burnout is real and management speaks to taking time off and importance of family but their actions are louder than their words. Employees are praised during town halls for working nights/weekends and putting in long hours to achieve goals. 

 - TAMs are expected to do far too many roles and easily jump from the lowest skilled customers to the most advanced. You're expected to demo, pre-sales engineer, post-sales engineer, support tier 1 - tier 3/4, support the platform and multiple modules, in-depth troubleshoot network/OS/other software if impacting use of Tanium, QA, train customers, write scripts, architect, document, on-site customer visits (non-COVID times), build and maintain your own lab environments, continually train on changing technology, etc.

- Customers are trained to 'ask and you shall receive'. Customers are not charged consulting hours and essentially anything can fall under the TAM support model. Sales Reps push for outlandish requests to be supported in order to upsell.

- The push to release quickly and continually results in an unsupportable amount of bugs. You'll spend a lot of time troubleshooting bugs in customer environments."

Employees believe in the product and the company, and support each other. Everyone wants to do better and make the product better. Employees want to do what is right for the customer.
Management, including senior management, has their head on straight. Managers listen when you point out problems. Senior management has a vision for where they need to change, they value the people that support their product, and they listen to their employees.
Privately held company can do the right thing and not just do what will make the stock rise this quarter.","Product is both broad and deep and is a lot to learn. Employees suffering from imposter syndrome is a common issue.
You handle front line cases. Sometimes there is great pressure to resolve issues quickly. 
Nights and weekend work is usual - if you aren't supporting customers, you are catching up on what couldn't get done during working hours.
Getting officially qualified to support the product is a long process."

My assessment is that the right executive leadership team is now in place to take the company to the next level. The product is a strategic, solution sale which is highly trusted by the largest and most demanding clients in the world. Culture is among the best I have worked for.","Very, very challenging strategic, solution sale. If you are looking for a layup, easy button point tool to sell that all customers want, with a short sales cycle, do not apply. You must grind and work overtime to close a single deal. Only the most professional and tenacious sales executives with deep rolodex relationships should apply. As a point of emphasis, the company has more technical resources than sales resources."

It's a seriously positive workplace, even as everyone has moved to remote work during the response to COVID-19, and my team has remained connected and able to continue doing effective work. Management is always doing their best to do the right thing and make sure that we can continue to win as a team. That sounds cheesy, but honestly, of all the places I've worked, Tanium has done the most to actively live their stated values.","Not a con exactly, but the work never ends, and it can feel like drinking from a firehose."

* Culture: It's challenging to keep the same culture as a company grows. Tanium has managed to not only maintain that team atmosphere, but it's actually improved since I've been here. Diversity and inclusion, work life balance, etc...are not just lip service here. It's part of the DNA.","This is tough as there's very few negatives. I would say we still are feeling some start-up type growing pains. Processes are revised and made more efficient on a regular basis. If you are a creature of habit that hates change, you might not be comfortable here. On the other hand, if you are someone who loves to drive initiatives and make things more streamlined, you'll find it very rewarding here."

I can honestly say - I'm very proud to be a member of the Tanium team.,None that I have found.
271,Tanium,Can be a great place to work with the right manager,2020-05-26,2.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Very good compensation. Work with smart collegues. Good culture when it is more than just lip-service. Successful business, not afraid to spend money. Good equipment.","One of Tanium's cultural values is ""win as a team"", yet when you seek the help from colleagues, it's seen as a weakness. My manager told me ""You should already know that"".


Be prepared to get criticized when your manager doesn't perceive your performance as good enough. This is expected - yet when I asked how to improve my performance, the first answer I got was ""software engineering is an art - it's hard to quantify. I can't just tell you how to improve."" When I tried to defend my performance and point out how I thought my performance was good, I was treated with hostility, my manager told me "" maybe you just don't want to work here."" I assured my manager that I would do *anything* I had to to remain working at Tanium.

When I was finally put on a performance improvement plan, I thought ""great, now I can do what I need to do to satisfy my manager"". I was given a month. I wasn't told my job was in jeopardy. In addition to my usual duties, this month included preparing for and giving a presentation at on off-site conference, and working with software engineers on other projects to integrate with the work I was doing. I did what was asked. My efforts were met with hostility. When I pointed out that I had more than double the PR's and commits than the other members of the team over a similar time period, that still wasn't good enough. Apparently it's insubordination to defend yourself. I was still fired. I was set up to fail. The improvement plan was simply an hr checkbox needed to justify firing me."

They take very good care of their people. Great pay, great benefits, great equity and great people. Very strong work/life balance. Employees genuinely want to help each other out. ""One team one fight"" is Tanium's mantra. And it comes from the very top of the company. And if that's not enough, they have a rock solid product and continue to develop it. Financially they are about as solid as you get - very well run company. I've worked for 6 other tech companies in my career and this one is definitely the best. This IS the company you are looking for.",Only downside is from a sales perspective - sales cycles can be long.

Tanium prides itself on Doing the Right Thing and Winning as a Team, and it shows in the helpful, kind way everyone at the company behaves. It's been so refreshing to be able to trust that my work will be appreciated and that I can ask for help without looking stupid. Tanium has a very flat org structure (all engineers, except for interns, start as Senior Software Engineers and there is no title promotion), which helps the best ideas win, instead of the ideas coming from the most senior title.","Tanium is a well-kept secret outside of the Enterprise IT community, so you'll be explaining what you do to a lot of your friends and family. They do an excellent job of training new employees though, so it won't be hard! Also, due to the excellent internal strategy of not using title changes for promotions, it's a little bit of an adjustment to learn how career growth works here."

At Tanium, our three simple core values appear in just about every interaction I have with other engineers and TAMs. People here really do believe in the mission we collectively own, and the unshakably great culture is the proof. The interview process is difficult, but if you make it through, you’ll no doubt be working with some of the most brilliant engineers in the world.

We are not on Fortune's Best Places to Work for nothing, and I am truly grateful to be apart of it.",Not really a con at all Tanium is not an easy sale and not a role for someone that is looking for a short sale cycle.

For the most part, the team is really engaged, driven, and passionate about their work. It creates an environment where you're constantly challenged and learning. 

Leadership seems to really care that employees are happy. I've seen many examples of employees being given opportunities to take on projects that they're passionate about even if it's not within the scope of their job. The leaders like providing these opportunities and connecting people with the work that will most engage them. 

There are some really cool and funny people at Tanium. They make work fun. 

Nice benefits like volunteer time off.","Part of Tanium's appeal is that everyone on the team is engaged and pulling their own weight. Unfortunately that's not the case on all teams. There are people that are poor performers AND lack professionalism/integrity, but for some reason are left alone to the dismay of their teams. I'm not sure why management won't do anything, and maybe there are good reasons, but it's really demoralizing for the rest of the team. These people are definitely an exception, not the rule.

Work/life balance can be tough as people are expected to carry a lot. Managers are flexible and understanding though."

337,Tanium,So much potential but lacking basic leadership best practices,2018-04-28,2.0,Sales,"Some of the best talent I have worked with. Differentiated product. Great salary and OTE. 

Great mission with a lot of intent around being a world class company that's not just trying to make revenue.

Made the move from bookings to ARR and that improved financial consistency and began creating a middle class in sales.

Unique financial stability for a company at its stage in all elements: Growth, cash flow, and total revenue.","The founders run the show and don't know what to look for in a senior leadership staff. The founders are brilliant but don't take feedback well.

This last year the leadership team started calling themselves the E-staff and estranged the work force. They started making a lot of top down decisions without getting buy-in from their respective teams.

The CRO was a poor hire and doesn't seem to like his own sales team... Moreover, he doesn't seem to realize people need to like him if he wants to retain and motivate his staff. The CRO tries to lead using Salesforce and a monthly webinar and thinks he's smarter than everyone. Despite the CRO's charisma on stage he lacks interpersonal self awareness.

Despite high OTE's in sales there is inconsistent achievement with a low percentage of sellers meeting/exceeding quota i.e. 30-40% vs. industry average (which is a more healthy 50-70%). The top 10% are making a lot of money but that list tends to change year to year.

The company doesn't tend to look at people's talent and ask where they could be most effective, taking a very binary perspective on promotions. Not putting genuine effort into employee engagement and maximizing their #1 asset, their people. Most of the E-staff are cheerleaders and won't stand up to the founders when things could be better.

In the time frame from Q4 2017 - Q1 2018 a lot of the best sales, PM and technical staff left because the E-staff appear to be satisfied living in their bubble and aren't genuinely interested in assuring employees feel good about working at the company.

The TAM team leadership needs to learn inter-department collaboration. The attitude they foster is unprofessional and adds to cultural divides between TAM's and Sales, two groups that should be lock step."

341,Tanium,"Some things are very right, some not so much",2018-04-01,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"They generally hire very smart people and the technology is fascinating. They have a noble mission that's worth supporting. Their development teams are lean and hardworking. The company is well-insulated against market upheaval, which leads to a feeling of job security (from outside influences anyway). The CEO and president actually understand the technology, which is a rare and precious thing, they consciously participate in shaping future development plus they understand what customer's need. 

They allow remote work and support (some) teams getting together in-person on a regular basis. This is really important to form and maintain relationships. They balanced these hardworking gatherings with fun events during the evenings. Exhausting but worth it.

The pay was good and the bonuses were excellent for some. Getting RSUs rather than stock options is a great way to keep employees vested in your success.","Their company culture, particularly on the technical side, is very white and mostly male.  Though the CEO has openly talked about not wanting a ""mono-culture"" they definitely have it. For example, as of when I left, there were only 3 female engineers and a handful of engineers from various parts of Asia.  Given their presence on the east coast and around the D.C. area, it was surprising that there weren't more African-American hires. There is no ""Silicon Valley"" excuse here, they hire across the nation and allow remote work. Their TAM organization is also 'bro-culture', being almost entirely white males who do lots of self-congratulatory back-slapping. Before I left, they were becoming aware of the imbalance, so maybe there is hope that they will course-correct.

They strongly depend on referrals to get new hires - which leads to more people similar to the ones they already have. It is understandable to want to hire only really talented people, but I think they overlook people with the potential to be really talented with a little shaping from management. In general though, management was too overloaded to invest in these types of hires - due to being a flat organizational structure.

I can't speak for people outside the technical depts, but there was definitely an issue with work/life balance for some employees. Management gave lip-service to everyone being adults and managing their own time wisely, but they rewarded those who worked excessive and ridiculous hours while management worked excessive hours themselves. If you choose to work here, be sure to have good boundaries about your time and set those expectations upfront."

There are some of the brightest developers and top IR specialists that are trying to change how the industry approaches security and operations. The company definitely values innovation by empowering the engineers. 

Something a bit different on the engineering side of things is the flat organizational structure as there are only a couple of levels between an engineer and the CEO. This is a good thing for those of us who aren't working for a title and just like to do our job. We are well compensated and treated like adults trying to create great tech.

For anyone who has been in the startup world for a bit you have definitely weathered through some bad CEOs. Part of the reason for coming to Tanium was the experience and leadership that the Hindawi's brought to the table. Without the experience they have brought to the table rarely do you see companies achieve what they have in such a short amount of time.","The biggest con is things are moving fast and, like most startups, there is no shortage of work.

Oh - also have had former Execs who were let go for everything from fraud, doing drugs onsite and screwing everything not nailed down , other moral and ethical failures make unfounded accusations to a gullible press.  Haters gonna hate.  It's clear the competition can't beat us head to head, so they've resorted to outsourcing personal attacks.

I don't need to worry about being politically correct.  I appreciate that I can speak my mind and I am heard.  Orion, and all the other executives, have an open door policy.  It is encouraged to speak up if we see something wrong.  When something is wrong its quickly corrected.  I wish more companies acted this way.

Believe it or not, there is encouragement from the top to ensure we are all adults are taking care of our personal needs. Work life balance is encouraged despite the job being demanding.

The team is incredibly smart, collaborative, and we are using cutting edge technology. By far, best in class salary, bonus and RSU's, if you are good at what you do, you will be compensated appropriately, and we are still private, so IPO is a very real future event.","Still layering on benefits, so perks like maternity/paternity leave are not refined, but 4 weeks of PTO is given.

So far I'm having a great time.","There aren't really any cons presently, but if you aren't a self-starter and able to self-manage, you might struggle.

390,Tanium,Best I've Ever Worked For!,2016-02-05,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"To say that Tanium is not your average company is a gross understatement.  Tanium is by far the most challenging, high op-tempo environment I've ever seen.  It's also the most positive environment I've ever worked in.  The company is highly technologist focused.  That is to say, it's not the sales org around which Tanium builds its culture, but rather the technical organization.  That's not to say that Sales isn't respected, just that it's not the normal ""I'm the sales guy, where's my SE!!!"" dynamic.  You'll find that the technical folks and the sales folks have a deep mutual respect.  Tanium does not employ ""SEs"".  The technical account managers (TAMs) are hard core engineers for the most part, but you won't find a prima donna among them (if you do, you'll likely find them headed out the door with a hearty ""good bye"" from their peers).  That's another great aspect; no drama.  Tanium employs adults, and what do you know, adults can pretty much get along, manage themselves and be productive out of the sheer joy of producing something meaningful.  It's really an incredible place.  I can't say how fortunate I consider myself to work here.  I've been in the cyber-security and engineering world for about 25 years and this place is just light years ahead of every other place I've been.","The hours can be long, but I do that to myself.  My position requires constant travel, but I knew that getting into it and it's a calculated investment.  The only real con I can think of over the past few years that I've been here is perhaps a lack of bacon in the early days.  Fortunately, that has been remedied of late."
391,Tanium,"If not ""THE Best"" Tech Company to work for.. close to it!",2016-03-01,5.0,Tech Account Management Director,The product ACTUAL WORKS unlike most current Security start-ups.

New hire COMM Dir from Google should fix that.
392,Tanium,Awesome company to work for,2016-02-05,5.0,Director of Technical Account Management,"Very fast paced environment.  Excellent compensation package.  There are so many highly technical people working here that finding out an answer to any question you can conceive is possible.  Great team-based atmosphere, but each individual is expected to be a self-starter, without requiring micromanagement (which does not exist here).","It is a very challenging environment, and if you are not willing to learn new skills, you won't be able to survive as an employee.  Excellence is expected of everyone, but the rewards are definitely worth it for anyone who's willing to put in the effort."
393,Tanium,"Great place, Innovative Tech",2016-02-05,5.0,Technical Account Manager,"This company is great to work for. There are people here that truly help you to be the best you can be. It's in everyone's interest for you to be at the top of your game, and that seems to be a part of the culture. Everyone helps out where they can, to make a solid unified front. The dedication to the product development and innovation as well as the betterment of the workforce, is top-notch.","Growing pains. The technology is legitimate and a lot of companies are realizing that. That means the company is expanding quickly in order to support the customer base. There's no simple formula for successful rapid growth, but I think leadership is steering the boat in the right direction."

In my 20 years working in IT and IA, I have never had the pleasure of being surrounded by the amazing talent here.  Everyone not only pulls their weight, but helps to ensure that you can pull yours.  If you have questions or need assistance, people will respond in minutes to help out.  However, they also expect you to have done your homework and work things out, and don't want to spoon feed you.  Being a self motivated self-starter is a must.  It's a highly dynamic and ""high speed, low-drag"" environment.","The ramp up process is lengthy, which really isn't a bad thing.

Not too many layers between sales and executive management. Founders and executives are very engaged, smart and hungry to succeed. Tanium employs only the best of the best and very smart technical people. Fast paced and fun place to work. No cap in earnings! Eventual IPO or acquisition will reward everyone who got private stock. Founders seem very genuine and generous. They ask a lot and give a lot.","Tight legally, especially as it relates to intellectual property. Tanium will walk away from a sale if the legal T's and C's aren't suitable regardless of deal or customer size. Sales reps must be very disciplined, self-motivated and capable of learning as they go. Technical people have equal and sometimes more authority than sales people. Sales cycles are long, 6 - 9 months."

406,Tanium,Best move I ever made,2022-03-18,5.0,Technical Account Manager,"We are trusted, and treated like adults and allowed to manage our own time and workload without scrutiny. This is due to Taniums rigorous hiring process, ensuring that they only hire those with the qualities necessary to be empowered with such trust. Tanium look for qualities in people that cannot be taught. Technology and skills can be acquired through learning, but you cannot learn being honest, having true integrity, and always ensuring you do the right thing, no matter the cost.

The job is both challenging and enjoyable. Every day we learn something new and every day is a school day which keeps things interesting and fresh. In Tanium, we truly are family, supporting each other and having each others backs through thick and thin. Knowledge is openly shared and learning and innovation is encouraged. Throughout all levels in the company, we are all considered peers and everyone, and i mean EVERYONE makes themselves available to everyone else to provide assistance and guidance where needed. There is no room for ego in Tanium.

Moving to Tanium was the best move I have made so far in my career. Gone are the management hierarchies where senior people are unreachable. Gone are the bullies who use superior knowledge to try and keep others ""in their box"" Gone are the ""gurus"" who know everything and build their little empires by keeping others in the dark and retaining arcane knowledge in an attempt to further make themselves indispensable or be held on a pedestal by others. Gone are those times where you reach out for help and no-one replies as they simply can't be bothered or have that ""its not my job"" you see all so often. EVERYONE pitches in, EVERYONE shares knowledge and experience openly , EVERYONE rallies to the side of others where needed....everyone behaves like they actually care about other members of the Tanium family, and that makes all the difference!

I can honestly say its the first place I've ever worked, where I look forward to the start of the working day!

- Management willing to invest and trust its employees","The hiring process: 
Before applying you should know that the company is really pushing to only hire the ""right person"" based on their very high standard expectations and as a result, the hiring process is quite demanding and you may have to go through 6 or 7 interviews.

The company provides the technical staff with everything they need to do their job.","Management has become very bizarre with some truly awful, bad, and terrible recent hires at the AVP level. A company that once genuinely cared for employee happiness no longer cares and is happy to let gifted people burn out, stop caring, and be miserable. A huge disparity exists between salaries on very similar roles with the 'friends' of management getting the big bucks and the rest getting mediocre pay.

Gone are the days when every employee had a purpose. Now we have managers of managers that don't seem to have any real role other than going to meetings and not doing anything.

Such a disappointment for me now. The company is an empty shell of what it used to be and middle management has killed off the best of the culture."

- Care / Understanding - The business really cares about individuals and their wants to grow/develop/learn.

The technical teams are first rate, smart and helpful.
The technology feels relevant and game changing.
Benefits and package is good and I'd say in the higher end of competitive.
It has won great places to work and for many it likely is, not sales.","Unless you get existing accounts (and you won't) then very few, probably less than a third, of people do their number. And from those that do then they'll have gone for over a year earning *nothing* (maybe 1% close something significant in year 1 and that is probably a because someone else who left did the hard yards before you).
Many of sales and sales ops verge on bullying and play political games - it's a about opportunity assessment and qualification but it'll invariably end up with you getting a beat down and launched underneath a bus. Leaders aspire to be John McMahon and the process is fine, the execution is oppressive.
They flip flop from what they want to be - is it security, is it operations - and suffer from a Jack of all Trades syndrome and a huge lack of identity and name recognition in both. If you leave for a leader in one of these area then ready the attorney as they can be rather litigious.
Check the contract, you get IPO stock but likely with a caveat they can take them or force you to sell them at a price they determine.
I was never actively encouraged to write +ve review here but it seems suspicious just how many appear after a bad review, like this, to push it waaaay down. Or maybe people write them in their first 6 months (mine would have been great) but when the reality hits and you don't see the money and the QBR heavy tackles start to come in.
There wasn't enough opportunity to go around 12-18 months ago, now they have hired a LOT of new sales people. Their hiring process is long, and I wish I had taken the time to contact people in sales previously who had left on LinkedIn, I sort of didn't want to know and convinced myself I'd just be successful like I always had been and ""look loads of great reviews all within 10 days of each other, that's not weird at all it's legit""."

Supportive culture.","It is old technology that they try to make compelling to customers by adding more and more partnerships, unfortunately they exist on paper only. 
The technology is very very high maintenance. Sweet spot is super narrow, sales cycles very long. Sales Executives need to be aware that 12 months and more for a first deal are the norm. The company is absolutely founder centric. Absolutely everything has to go over “this” table. And “it has to go to the founder” is many times used to stop the process."

435,Tanium,Best company I've worked for..,2021-10-09,5.0,Enterprise Services Engineer,"In doing my research before joining, on Glassdoor there were numerous glowing testaments, which I took with a pinch of salt. Not only does Tanium advertise a company who treats its employees very well, and offers a great range of benefits and career opportunities to grow using world class technology, In my year at the company, it is this and much more, that is why it's the best company I've worked for. And I've been around many companies and industries over a couple of decades.

Great supportive team. Imposter syndrome was real for me during the 'firehose' of new hire training but the support available from management, peers and training staff is amazing. If you need help, no one is too busy, but you'll find someone from anywhere in the world happy to jump on a call with you and help. You are treated like an adult, and I've genuinely yet to meet someone I don't get on with. 

The culture is so important to this company, that the rigorous interviewing process ensures everyone is humble and leaves their ego at the door and all pushes in one direction to succeed. Even joining during Covid, my manager who was US based was so professional, that she would be available on UK time to support me during my onboarding.","A constant comment from me anywhere I've been is 'too many meetings...' Tanium has a few, but refreshing comments recently from Orion, is if your in a meeting which is adding no value and has no defined outcomes or actions - just leave the meeting. So what would be a con, is now a plus."

Excited to see this company scale!","Company branding can be improved -  well established in NAM and EMEA, but little to no brand awareness in APAC region. Resources are widely available but requires a little bit of site hopping, as there are little bits of information everywhere, which increases the complexity of sourcing especially for new hires.
