No room for getting better position unless you know people in the higher ups"
1,Texas Instruments,Overtime Pay for non-exempt hourly employees is calculated and paid by the day,2022-03-04,4.0,Equipment Technician,"Okay, let's get into the weeds shall we? Compressed work week (CWW) shifts, which command your presence for 12.5 hours (1 hour is an unpaid 1 hour lunch), the employee is paid 8 hours straight-time and 3.5 hours at time and a half - each day! CWW shifts have a bi-monthly pay period so one week consists of 3 days and the next is 4 days. Each day consisting of 12.5 hours physically present and 11.5 of those hours being calculated for payroll. Therefore, one week has 24 straight-time and 10.5 over-time hours and the second week has 29.5 straight-time hours with 16.5 over-time hours. Remember to calculate correctly! Although each day is calculated for over-time, the second week reaches it's 40-hour limit on the 4th day after only 5.5 hours so the 5 hours remaining on the 4th day is all over-time not just the 3.5 hours as calculated in the days previous. Also, night shift employees enjoy a 15% differential which is factored in so that straight-time is equal to 1.15 times their base-rate and over-time is calculated at 1.725 times their base-rate! Absolutely delicious!","Unable to find where Texas Employment law is requiring Texas Instruments to pay their employees in this manner. Therefore, this payment structure could all fade at any given time."
2,Texas Instruments,Manufacturing clean room production lead,2022-03-29,5.0,Shift Leader,Texas Instruments work environment great with diversity inclusion and lots of opportunities within the company for advancement.,The 12hr shifts are very long and takes awhile to adapt on a compressed schedule. Requires an extreme amount of dedication.
3,Texas Instruments,Good place to start your career,2022-04-04,3.0,Applications Engineer,"Exciting projects to learn from, good rotation programs,","Too much politics, bureaucracy. Management don't know what their doing, Confined to your role: apps do apps, marketing focused on marketing, validation in lab, bored doing the same tests."
4,Texas Instruments,Good Opportunities for Meaningful Projects & Continuous Learning Mindset,2022-02-28,5.0,Applications Engineer,Learning & growth championed within role; flexibility of each day being different in scope and content; interface with engineering customers & develop breadth across various applications; exposure to various industry software and tools; better understanding of product design through understanding integrated circuit specs/performance  ,Flexibility of each day differing in content can be daunting when a problem or important need arises; some workflows can be isolating or require a lot of study/research
5,Texas Instruments,Good Company,2022-03-27,4.0,Manufacturing Technician,"The work was easy, in a clean room, temperature-controlled environment. Most of the managers were decent and caring and kept the heat from rolling downhill so you could concentrate on the task at hand.","TI was an ok company to work for. The pay was good, raises were not, benefits were good. The work was easy, in a clean room, temperature-controlled environment. Most of the managers were decent and caring and kept the heat from rolling downhill so you could concentrate on the task at hand."

8,Texas Instruments,A bellwether company,2022-03-26,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Competitive work environment
Culture of winning
Ethical; winning ethically",Family and friends believe we build calculators
9,Texas Instruments,Good Company,2022-03-21,4.0,Applications Engineer,They care about their employees and try to ensure that everyone has the support they need. Joining as a NCG you will learn a lot and gain valuable experience rather quickly.,Employee turnover is quite high. We find ourselves unable to keep good people which can make the job very difficult and hectic sometimes. I often find myself as the only person left on my team and feel that I have no real peers.
10,Texas Instruments,Fantastic environment,2022-03-01,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Flexible work hours, even pre-pandemic. Great work/life balance. Challenging work. Opportunity for growth. Fulfilling work. Great engagement from leaders. Wonderful, beautiful campus with on-site amenities like a cafe, coffee shop and gym. Truly the best leaders I’ve ever worked with; they are empathetic and trustworthy.","Because of the technology we support, there can be a big learning curve which can feel daunting but there’s a great support system in place to help anyone encountering roadblocks."
11,Texas Instruments,Environment,2022-04-04,3.0,Technician,Profit sharing benefits were good,The management style didn't work out well for me
12,Texas Instruments,TI,2022-04-04,4.0,Engineer,Very very flexible work hours,I can’t think of anything
13,Texas Instruments,Proceed with caution,2022-02-07,1.0,Manufacturing Specialist,The only good thing about this company is the bonus.,"Management that will get paid hand over fist for doing half the work you do. If you apply here be ready to work yourself to the bone. I walk 12 miles a night, never get a chance to sit down, and am constantly exhausted trying to uphold the work amount that is put on me. The people who have been here for years all have knee problems, back problems, carpel tunnel- you name it they’ve got it- all due to the forced amount of work and never ending walking. The schedule may seem nice, but if you work nights (for that nice 15% pay raise) you basically don’t have a weekend. You’re spent trying to recover what hell you’ve put your body through the past four days you’ve worked. No one in management cares, you’re nothing but a walking number and no matter how much strain you put yourself through to get your numbers up, it still isn’t enough. Please, beware. Work some place that doesn’t frown upon you for having to take 10 minutes out of your 12 hour shift to use the restroom."
14,Texas Instruments,Great place to start,2022-03-23,4.0,Product Marketing Engineer,"TI is a great place to start, everyone goes through the rotation programs. Most people leave within 5 years for better pay and promotions elsewhere. Many smart engineers that you will come across at the company.","Hard to get recognized in such a big company, upward mobility is not so easy. Average person is working at least 45-50 hrs a week."
15,Texas Instruments,"Great place to grow your skills, just don’t think you’ll get a reference",2022-02-03,2.0,Software Engineer IGNITE,Great place to grow your skillset in whatever it is you’re working on. I had the opportunity to work on a ton of high impact projects and lay the foundation for several major initiatives in manufacturing and customer engagement,Work life balance & support after deciding to leave the company. I worked very diligently to make sure nothing was left unknown to the team before leaving so I could have a good reference. My old boss went completely silent a few months after I left. Others who I worked with said they may not be able to represent me as a TI employee. Major red flags.
16,Texas Instruments,Deep Technical Knowledge,2022-03-31,4.0,Process Engineer,deeply technical industry with lots of opportunities to learn,spend more in training resources to increase onboarding ramp rate
17,Texas Instruments,Superb company,2022-03-16,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great culture, great benefits, great people",Nothing that sticks out at all
18,Texas Instruments,Great,2022-03-15,5.0,Software Engineer,Pays well for the dallas area.,Work 100 hour weeks occasionally
19,Texas Instruments,Unlucky With Team,2022-03-09,2.0,Test Engineer,"Lots of great hard working people at TI, good benefits.",Just was unlucky with the team I was on. I had to go in the lab at night and my coworker who reviewed me would go in during the day. He thought I didn't work hard enough because he didn't physically see me in the lab often due to us going in at different times. I pulled 60-80 hour weeks but it was my word against the word of a coworker of the manger's of 20+ years.
20,Texas Instruments,A company where you’re just a number! They hope the lowest.,2022-03-16,1.0,Equipment Engineering Technician,There are no pros for this company unless you’re moving from Samsung.,"Tool to technician ratio. Dishonest hiring strategies. Pay. Environment. Work life balance.

At this company, there are a number of technicians with the same years of experience, same tool set experience, and even coming from the exact same position at the same company at the same time that make drastically different hourly pay. We are talking 12+ dollars an hour difference! This is because one asked for a low number thinking that is typical pay for the industry and the other asked high. I work with a guy on night shift that makes 28 an hour while his friend is making 40 an hour with less experience for the same exact position. Management and HR openly accept people at low amounts and then question why they leave later. This is bad business imo. My discussion with my supervisors while attempting to “retain” me included them factoring in my night shift differential as my pay. They use this to compare against a higher hourly day shift position and act as if this is why your pay is what it is. A night shift differential is given because NOBODY wants night shift and you are missing out on time with your family so they pay you an extra amount based on that aspect. IT IS NOT TO MAKE THE SAME HOURLY AS A DAYSHIFT EQUIVALENT POSITION WHILE WORKING NIGHTS! Do yourself a favor and go to a company that will pay you what you’re worth and not just what you say the minimum you’ll accept is. There are much better options and much better environments to spend your days at! Check Broadcom and Qorvo first before landing here. Don’t short yourself while performing more work than you would at almost any other company."
21,Texas Instruments,Great Safe Place to Work,2022-03-08,5.0,Software Developer,Easy and good work-life balance,Pay could be a bit better
22,Texas Instruments,Good starting company,2022-03-27,4.0,Analog Design Engineer,People are really smart and you will learn a lot,Pay is not competitive. Work life balance is not that good for the pay
23,Texas Instruments,Good pay,2022-03-28,4.0,Equipment Technician,"Great people, Relaxed environment, Freedom","Pushes liberal agenda
Poor training opportunities"
24,Texas Instruments,Collaborative Environment,2022-01-03,5.0,Packaging Engineer,"Collaborative and relaxed work environment. Everyone is on a first-name basis. Flexible work schedule - great for parents. Pay and time bank are competitive. Benefits like donation match, adoption assistance, discounts, concierge, and 401K match are competitive, as well. Annual profit-sharing bonus is incredibly competitive and gives employees further ownership of their work. At TI, ethics are a priority, which makes me proud to work here.","Health insurance is lacking, but I suspect that owes to a majority of employees who would prefer lower premiums than good coverage and lower deductions. That's great for those who don't need to use their insurance much. Not so great for employees who do. The Health Savings Account does help offset this concern, though."
25,Texas Instruments,"Overall, a decent experience",2022-03-16,4.0,Product Marketing Engineer,"The pay is great, lots of bonuses, and lots of PTO","They won't allow you to be fully remote and move despite a large group of jobs could be remote. Personally, my manager did a terrible job managing people and the job can be really stressful depending on your team."
26,Texas Instruments,Good company,2022-02-10,5.0,Field Applications Engineer,"I have learned more in my last 4 months than 4 years of college. The rotation program is hardcore, and is designed to have you learn all analog and sales fundamentals in six months.",Rotation for FAEs is extremely difficult. Many late nights and stressful projects. They really push you as an engineer and as a person
27,Texas Instruments,Mixed experience,2022-03-15,3.0,Human Resources Administrator,"Great benefits, generous time off, and 20% profit sharing. Coworkers are great.","Upper management will step on anyone to get ahead in their own career. Managers give special treatment to other managers / VP's. Keep employee's who don't do their job, yet let go emploee's who broke a mask rule."
28,Texas Instruments,High Stress/High-ish Reward,2022-03-14,4.0,Manufacturing Supervisor,Pay is good especially if you work the Night Shift.,"Very stressful with Management's demands/expectations. 
Specialists are of low quality hence the job is mostly just a high paying babysitting role but it gets old after awhile."

30,Texas Instruments,Best Company for Analog,2022-02-25,5.0,Product/Test Engineering Manager,Great ethics. Nice profit sharing. Technical work culture.,Not many opportunities in upper management for Test and Product managers.
31,Texas Instruments,N/A,2022-03-23,4.0,Anonymous Employee,Great bonuses at the beginning of the year,Cycling through managers every couple of years
32,Texas Instruments,"Overall decent company and benefits, some areas need improvements",2022-02-10,3.0,Systems Engineer,"Decent company and decent benefits. Good mentoring from the experienced, but rapidly shrinking experienced workforce. Most managers are understanding of work life balance. Good profit sharing maxing out at 20% for the last few years. Discounted employee stock options with 15% discount. 4% 401k company match. Best chance for promotion is in managerial ladder. Big company with many groups makes it easy to move around while maintaining benefits, learning different roles and functions, and obtaining experience. Each group can have very different work environment and culture. Work tends to be highly involved with local offices and customers in China, India, and Europe. Good set of company values. Large field group with prescence in many countries. Lately taking some efforts to improve diversity in upper management and technical ladder. Some managers are very good and do not micromanage their direct reports.","Some really awful managers that somehow maintain their position through the years. Little diversity in technical ladder with big emphasis on design engineers. Hard to get promoted in the technical ladder. Extreme cost cutting on employee computers, software, and IT departments, while company pays for a lot of customer visits and travel. High push for security and locking down computer resources that gets in the way of doing your job. Very old lab equipment with very long process for any capital expenses. Mostly hiring new college graduates. Most innovation is just incremental, not given much latitude to experiment. Due to large number of new college graduates, experienced workers spend a lot of time training new employees. Most new college graduates do not stay more than 5 years, so experienced engineers are constantly training people. Prepare for many early morning and late evening meetings due to working with co-workers in China and India. Centralized labs facilities are very noisy, crowded benches, small or no monitors, and difficult to concentrate. Some open office areas deter collaboration rather than foster it due to distracting noise. Management highly focused on short term gains rather than more involved and well thought long term plans. For example, big push to sell what we have and have very short design cycles were features are removed, instead of trying to understand why a device does not sell and spend the time to make a better device. Most employee career focus is just for new college graduates, so experienced workers tend to stall and leave the company. Your salary growth is highly dependent on your initial hiring salary. Hard to catch up if you fail to negotiate a good salary or we’re hired close to a recession. You might find yourself a few years down the road earning less than a new college graduate a few years down the road. Texas locations suffer from personnel that have highly partisan views that does not favor science and regard for facts. Little diversity at upper management that has seen some advances in the last few years. Some filed personnel are not very technical and act as salesmen."
33,Texas Instruments,Great,2022-02-12,5.0,Engineer,Quality company to work for. Lots of opportunities to grow and move as long as you have solid foundation and good work ethic.,Catching up to be competitive in terms of tech incentives/salaries/solutions.

35,Texas Instruments,PROCESS ENGINEER TECHNICIAN W\TI,2021-10-18,4.0,Process Engineer Technician,"Being employed with TI gives a sense of security because once hired full-time your job is safe. The benefits are good and Team members are allowed to put aside up to 4% of their salary and TEXAS INSTRUMENTS will match 50% of it. TI also offers annual bonus (profit sharing) at a max of 20% . base Pay of a Process Engineer Technician working with company over 15 years 53,580.80 per year","Raises are low, may find yourself working a part-time job due to inflation, TI doesn't give raises that will match inflation or increase your salary to align with inflation. Profit sharing does help but you have to wait a year before getting the bonus only to find you're using it to pay off debt accumulated the prior year. Constantly on the grind and the morale is not that great. Merit pay to employees that may excel in their current positions is non-existent."

The compensation seems to be lagging as of late. They sort of force you to either feel comfortable with your salary or consider what else is out there. They will always give you just enough meat on the bone to make you feel like it's worth staying, and that's even for a above average performer"

You are expected to say yes, which does mean that people are willing to attempt to find and answer but also means it can be pretty stifling for creativity. It is also a very lean company where money isn't spent on superfluous perks (but on the other side, that means that they have plenty to donate back to the community and also means there is profit sharing for the employees). Lastly, TI expects a lot of grassroots movements to happen and this can be a significant disconnect when it comes to management and individual contributors. The mindset from management can be, ""that's fine, you're welcome to start/do something if you'd like, but do it on your own time"" and it doesn't necessarily mean you'll get a lot of support."

333,Texas Instruments,Limited growth,2021-06-20,4.0,Design Engineer,Good learning culture with quality work life balance,"With multiple rounds reductions, very few opportunities for growth."
334,Texas Instruments,Overall very good but it can be stressful at times,2020-12-07,4.0,Manufacturing Process/Equipment Engineering,"Pay is good. They hired me out of college in 2018 for 75k in Dallas, TX.
Depending on how the company does for a given year you are eligible for 0-20% of your salary as a bonus.
Work culture is pretty nice","Depending on the factory you work in, and your role, it can be stressful at times and have long hours. TI makes most of their money on the enginuity of their manufacturing engineers. A vast majority of the tools are old. The engineers are taught to get every once of life from their machines. That isn't necessarily a con, but that is the mindset the company has."
335,Texas Instruments,"Great company to work for, limited choices on career decisions though",2021-02-09,4.0,Access Rotation Program,"Great work/life balance, profit sharing is a great benefit. In my experiences, all of my managers/directors that I worked for have been fantastic.",My biggest issue with being a part of the ACCESS rotation program is the limited input you get into what your next rotations are. A common complaint I heard from other coworkers in the program was that they were getting places into rotations they did not want. Even top performers did not get very much say in what team/function they were placed into for their next rotation.
336,Texas Instruments,"Great Place, great culture",2021-02-17,5.0,Technical Sales,"They hire very dedicated, hardworking people. They are lean, but profitable. TI expects everyone to do their part to contribute to the success of the company.",None I can think of.

If you are a minority other than black and Hispanics, you are in trouble as you can never reach top due to glass ceiling"
339,Texas Instruments,TI Continues To Improve Its Mighty Legacy,2019-10-04,5.0,Software Engineer,"TI has a challenging but worthwhile environment. There are very smart people that work here but they don't show it. They're mostly native Texans. Humble and grateful people. There's a reason the average TIer lasts 15 years here - because they make it hard to leave. The company has great benefits that are competitive. It's a fortune 200 company and you get exactly what'd you expect and more. There are great leaders at TI, especially the ones at the very top. TI does diversity right, too. They don't just diversify on race like some of the other silicon valley type companies, but a many different attributes. Politics and bureaucratic incompetence just doesn't get in the way of your work or the companies mission, unlike some companies. With all of the extracurriculars that TI has, there is opportunity to make gen-u-ine friends here","If you don't like Texas you probably don't belong at TI. As a matter of fact you probably don't belong in Texas. Please, just stay in California. Depending on where you live, the commute can be pretty bad. The DFW area in particular is getting crowded so there's not much you can do about it. Again, stay in California. While there is a lot of mobility at TI, it doesn't always translate to a significant increase in salary. You have to understand that working in IT at TI means you are fundamentally supporting the business, so you won't be on the cutting edge of technology necessarily. Of course that does have its perks, but you'll have to decide for yourself if that's desirable. In my opinion it's hard to beat."

603,Texas Instruments,"Only intern here. Gaslighting, breadcrumb culture.",2019-09-04,3.0,Product Marketing Engineer,"You will have a great experience as an intern and rotator and possibly for the first year or so after your deploy to your full-time role. When I started, we had a 2-week orientation and really got to bond with both PME and Sales rotators. That bond is something that made TI feel like a family to me and not just a place to work. (They've since gotten rid of that culture) My peers were and still are some of my best friends. 

There's lots of growth in  corporate behavior, work ethic, communication skills, and presentation skills that can transfer well to other companies.  

The PME role allows for domestic and international travel (unless they cut that out too now), which is fun but a lot of work. 

They have a lot of training opportunities that are of no cost to the employee that many employees do not take advantage of.  I highly recommend taking these courses, even if that means taking a day from work to do so. 

The only jobs I recommend at TI are HR and Digital Marketing.","PAY / PROMOTIONS  / WORK-LIFE BALANCE
Starting pay is great but over the years, the raises are not competitive. They pay you less and work you more than other companies. I have not heard of a single person unhappy with their decision to leave TI. 

The culture of the managers is to make you feel like you should be GRATEFUL for the breadcrumb raises and to not even ask for more. They make you believe that the typical annual inflation raise (that every other company offers) is a merit-based raise. It's actually very, very difficult to get a true raise, bonus, or RSU. They don't openly talk about the fact that there even is such a thing as a mid-year raise to be considered for. Other companies give you shares when you start, an annual inflation raise, AND a true merit-based raise. And other companies have a better work-life balance. TI will say they do, but when you start working 10-14 hour days, you'll understand it's just words.  This gaslighting behavior is one of the biggest reasons I left and never want to go back. It's a toxic culture. 

Managers across the board have fallen short on promises made to employees whether they're raises, bonuses, RSUs, or promotions. Promotion methods are very unclear. While there are some great managers, there are a good number of bad managers that seem to be in that position because they're pals with upper management. Even when many, many people leave TI or leave the group to escape that manager, that doesn't register with HR or they don't care.  This is not a good place for upward mobility. 

TECHNOLOGY
TI is not longer an innovative company. They're never going to be at the forefront of technology. They're followers and it's not that exciting. 

ROTATION PROGRAMS
The rotation programs were one of the biggest reasons I recommended joining TI but now they've cut so much from the programs that you don't get the benefits from them. They seem to play the role of temps during their rotation: cheap labor to do menial tasks that product lines don't have the time to do. If you get a good manager, you'll learn and grow a lot. But most of the time, rotators are treated this way.  Also they got rid of the pay bump you get when you deploy to your full-time role. 

SALES / FIELD ROLES
They're turning the TSR role more into a data-entry role and the FAE is taking on both responsibilities. I do not recommend joining TI if you want to go into a TSR or FAE role. 

PRODUCT MARKETING ENGINEER
This is a made-up role by TI (or maybe ADI, who pays more) that combines the responsibilities of a Business Development Manager and a Product Marketing Manager while paying you one salary for 2 roles. It's also difficult to translate this role to other companies. Most other companies have never heard of a ""Product Marketing Engineer"".  While this role is fun with strategy and all the travel, it doesn't help a lot with becoming an expect as a BDM or as a PMM. It may not be a great move for your career unless you want to stay with TI. 

TI knows they're the main company to be at in Dallas as a EE and they treat their employees accordingly."

If you want to travel, you can travel in the right role to your heart’s content. You’ll work with good people from all over the world. The work is generally interesting with opportunities to learn new things.","Feedback from the bottom is, at best, not really encouraged and, at worst, actively discouraged. There is no mechanism for holding managers accountable to their employees beyond creating an HR issue or the employee going head-to-head with their own manager (which is toxic to anyone who touches it). Employee annual pay reviews happen behind closed doors with no employee input. (You have five years of good-excellent reviews, but this year had a poor review because your boss is going through a divorce and can’t separate personal issues from work? Too bad, no one in management asks why a good employee turned bad, you just have to suck it up.) There is no company culture to prioritize managers actively communicating to employees to make sure they don’t get surprised by a bad end-of-year review. Employee development is solely up to the discretion of the manager as it’s not a mandatory part of the TI management culture."

638,Texas Instruments,"Conservative, steady company which lacks an innovative spirit",2016-10-27,3.0,Systems Engineer,"* TI's greatest asset is its people.

* Very large company, enabling a curious mind to dabble in a number of different areas over the course of a career.

* Solid compensation and benefits

* Finally getting serious about renovating the campus.","* Since it's the only major semiconductor company in North Texas, a lot of people stick around for decades.  They are called lifers.  This prevents young, ambitious talent from growing into leadership roles.  Not all lifers are bad.  A lot have great ideas and a wealth of knowledge.  But, there are some lifers that are dead weight and need to be removed to make way for fresh ideas.

* Politics and Bureaucracy.  It's a big company, so it comes with the territory.  But, the combination of the two tends to stifle innovative and creative ideas from ever taking root.

* ""Old Boy Network"": some of the lifers mentioned above have escaped layoffs and have landed cushy roles via the network.  They always seem to be one step ahead of strategic shifts and the fallout that ensues.  Governing philosophy of these types is to hire capable people below them to do all the work, which frees them up to travel the globe on the company's dime.

* Lack of Innovation and Entrepreneurial Thinking.  Upper management is dominated by sales and marketing types.  Primarily a formulaic, sales-driven approach to things, which is odd for a historically innovative technology company.  Not enough engineering thought leaders in upper management, which leads to a lack of inspirational engineering leadership throughout the company."
639,Texas Instruments,Overall TI is a good place to work at but the company's focous is constantly changing.,2008-08-14,3.0,Design Engineer,"TI offers a relaxed environment for employees. A lot of resources are available for employees to accomplish their requires tasks and also to advance their career. Training is encouraged by management. The company employs some of the brightest engineers in the world. This creates a good learning environment. Most design facilities are located in Dallas Texas. A low cost of living place compared of most other high tech places. In general, TI is very competitive when it comes to compensation. TI does business in multiple area, therefore, there are multiple large design organizations. Not all design groups are the same, some are great to work with others are not.","TI in general has an old school culture that is resistive to change. Some of the design groups still prioritize seniority above performance when it comes to advancement.  This is not the norm across the company, but it does exist.  As a result of this old school culture, many of the engineers being promoted are not great example for their team in terms of performance and knowledge.  No all design groups are like this, some of the newer groups working on newer technologies are more in tune with the current culture which values performance and contribution more than seniority. In addition, management in general are very risk averse. Even when the results of change are obvious in terms of increased productivity, management are hesitant to change current ways of doing things."
