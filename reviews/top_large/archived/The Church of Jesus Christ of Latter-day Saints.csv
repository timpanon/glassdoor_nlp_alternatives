I worked here for 5+ years and was only given an increase of $8000 from start to finish. I was essentially getting a pay decrease as the rate of inflation outpaced my pay raises.

-People care about helping the work progress- I like knowing that I am making a difference
-The company generally splurges on good software
-Good health care and benefits
-You will learn a lot because there is a lot to be done","-Sexism (I have been asked multiple times when I'm going to have kids, and my manager told me that a co-worker told him not to hire me because I would just take maternity benefits and leave... I've worked here for five years and also can't have kids, so that has been a real struggle.)
-Overworking- for a period of about six months, I worked 50-70 hour weeks because two people on my team quit. It took more than six months for management to hire replacements, so I was expected to do the work of three people and was constantly berated for not getting things done. Overtime is expected because it is the Lord's work. I took a day and a half of leave last week for the first time in half of a year and was made to feel super guilty about it, someone literally said, ""glad YOU had a break!"" to me.
-Poor pay and advancement- Do not expect your job to keep up with inflation, no matter how many hours you put in and no matter how hard you work. The people who determine raises do not know you, and the pay-raise process is archaic. Do not expect to ever be able to advance if you are in any kind of technical field. I've been told that I was ""absolutely crucial to my team"" and ""had done so much"" and then given a 2% raise (""the highest in the department!"") from what I was told.
-Fudging Numbers and general dishonesty- I've been asked for data on multiple occasions where the results did not look pretty and was then accordingly told to show it a different way or cut off a couple months' worth of data at the end of a graph. Nobody cares about your opinion or being honest, they just want to look good.
-Split technology department- ICS and church employees don't work well together; because of the contract model, there are many crucial datasets built with Jenga tiles. Models are built really hastily, are rarely documented, and then they are abandoned as the people who built them simply leave because their contract ended."

I was promised perks that weren't actually offered to someone in my position. I wasn't able to give notice because I was still TRAINING, but later found out that they marked me re-hireable due to this. This corporation doesn't walk the walk that the church 's doctrines teach."

They only meet with regular custodians when giving disciplinary action or when there's been a complaint.

They ignore opinions different than theirs.

Human resources is a joke. They are not there to protect you, they are there to protect the name of the church. And many times that means sacrificing the morally right thing to protect the name. I personally never had this problem, but I was around it so often and I felt guilty about it. I struggled that in the church history department was trying to being transparent but rewrite history in a favorable light. If you notice Church Historians are no longer Historians, they are Lawyers.
Glad I got out, unfortunately I was stuck there too long. I struggled with business decisions are made only by the spirit. I believe we all can use the spirit in our work, but only higher management are worthy to recieve the spirit. 
I also didn't like how they don't have real health insurance, they are called Benefit Administrators. They denied my wife's hysterectemy due to cancer risk because we didn't have enough kids (I only have 4) to justify a hysterectomy we needed 6.
They also showed a video upon hiring that said they have a competitive salary but take into account the law of concentration. That is not consecrated, that is a tax. If I could opt into it then it would be consecrated.

None of the supervisors have management training, and there is no way for them to receive feedback as to their performance. Coworkers are frequently jealous, and unable to deal with conflict face to face. There is a substantial amount of gossip, betrayal, and terrible communication. You would expect more from “the” Church of Jesus Christ. But sadly that just isn’t the case. There is no ability to think freely or to voice your opinion without threat or dismissal. My employment here has led me to therapy for years. You also don’t get paid much. Terrible, terrible experience in which they control every aspect of your life.

Most people really develop great relationships with other coworkers on their teams.,"Department management is super unqualified to do their job and are completely out of touch. Finance and budget is really screwy and it messes with project deadlines and destroys creativity. For some reason within the last few years, management has decided it's time to downsize (not based on any actual data) but because they've ""felt impressed"" to do so. They even told us, ""we predict that the work load over the next year is going to significantly decrease. so in order to prepare for that, we're going to let all of our outsource contracts expire. our current workforce should be enough to handle that reduced load."" Then into the next year the workload more than doubled. They essentially said, ""oops sorry. we kinda goofed on that one. But no we're not going to hire additional employees to help with the workload. "" In fact, as more and more people leave, most of those positions are not being backfilled. Budget cuts are everywhere. No more professional development. No more offsites. No more travel. No more team lunches. And when employees leave, their spots are not backfilled. All-hands meetings are a complete joke and are extremely demotivating because of the shocking lack of awareness our management team has of what's going on in the department. This is the most siloed organization I have ever seen. It's absolutely full of territorialism, backbiting, ladder climbing, and ridiculous politics. Product management constantly plays what many like to call ""general authority poker"" where a project's priority is not determined by the actual researched needs of members throughout the world, but how many general authorities the PMs can ""sell"" their product ideas to. (I've seen this happen first hand btw and it's disgusting.) Our department sends out workforce surveys all the time, and even reports back to us on what the most common points of feedback are. Yet no changes are ever made. If you work here, you will be ignored, you will be undervalued, and you will most likely never see any of your work go anywhere."

- The Church is generally recognized by other companies as a great place to learn, some good training goes on for the most part.","- Some people don't care to get to know you, or talk to you, or explain stuff to you. I sat with a team for months and never really got to know any of them, despite efforts to strike up conversations. They just come in, type and leave. 
- I often found out I was doing work that is typically someone else's job, but no one ever took the time to explain everyone's role on the team. This is related to the above point. And yes, I asked for clarification a few times, but was not given sufficient explanation.
- The contingent model (contract workers) is a bit wacky. I was told that if/when I leave, I would be backfilled, and yet there is no opportunity to go from contract worker (2 year max) to a full time employee. This leads to lots of entry -mid level turnover and retraining.
- In many ways, it seems a bit like a personality contest. I moved teams several times due to ""budget issues"" which I won't deny were there, but could have been easily worked out (and when I switched teams, another replaced me). I think it stemmed more from a partner and I not able to relate to each other more than capability of doing the job.

Though it's obvious that the Church runs the corporation, there are times that corporation needs to be run as the corporation and corporate decisions must be made. Because the CEO (Presiding Bishop) has many other responsibilities besides running the corporation, paralysis in decision making can occur. There is no single leader to push directives and hold the entire Corporation accountable, so initiatives fracture, are modified, and fail."

Compared to most call centers, you're working with members of the church. Seldom do you get distressed/upset employees calling in.","I came in as a part-time employee seeking full-time employment. I was looked at favorably to be promoted quickly but after a seasoned manager ""left"" my fate was left up to the politics of hiring with the new managers of the team. Which were, they favored married individuals, with families, school, etc over individuals who were just single such as myself. I saw this time and time again where I would have more time and experience at the GSC and was still placed second behind that group. Management is new so their hiring skills are rather incompetent. I was micromanaged and it was unpleasant. I felt undervalued and my work unappreciated. I felt management didn't care about me as an individual. Feedback was poor and did not help me improve in any way. Even after I had made the changes they requested, they did pay any attention.  I was looking forward to continue working for the church, I took a massive pay and time cut but clearly that didn't matter to them. When management had changed, people were realizing they could go elsewhere with a better environment. Employees were dropping faster than they could hire. We were moving into the ""Slow season"" and I was constantly on calls the moment I got in and we were scolded if we took too long of breaks or lunches or heaven forbid work on a ticket a little longer, yet they failed to hire more employees. 
Food is way overpriced, and there is nowhere else to get food unless you want to jog to crown burger and be late anyway. 
The hours were bad for me, I could only work 28 hours a week and was traveling long distances. There are only a few slots per team that are allowed full-time. About 15 or so per team and around 3 individuals per team get full-time. I won't go back to the GSC."

I *really* like the work and the work environment and the people. The church is very competitive with salary and benefits. The health insurance through DMBA is especially generous--better than any large employer I am aware of. On-site gym and health center (and cafeteria) at downtown Salt Lake City campus. 401k matching. Maternity leave (7 weeks). Inexpensive UTA train and bus passes. On-site parking, free (including a lot of covered parking). Every department potentially has a different culture and not every manager or situation is ideal, but overall people are trying to work hard and be kind and do quality work. Great sense of mission and unity that can motivate you even through more boring or challenging times. Employer extremely stable--not going anywhere. Merit raise evaluations annually lead to raises virtually every year for most employees.","Dress code is quite conservative--for example, men required to wear suit and tie daily at most downtown Salt Lake City locations. No bonuses or other similar incentives. Slow-moving, conservative bureaucracy can be frustrating. Some departments are relying more and more on contract employees. Organization is reluctant to move toward flex time or telecommuting or other nontraditional approaches. Organization is extremely male-centric (probably north of 90 percent) in leadership positions at the managing director and director levels, though that seems to be changing a bit.

Department management is MUCH better than it was 2+ years ago. But under the new managing director, all of the second level management are the same folks who have been around for years.","Change is touted as a constant, but it never results in visible improvements. There is a flavor of the day mentality that long time employees have seen for many, many years. Major process and tool changes happen annually. Major reorganizations happen every few years. Significant layoffs happen about every 5 years. Tons of folks are hired as contracted ESG or Nexeo employees with an implied promise that if they work hard and do well, they'll be hired on full time. We spend tons of time and money training them and incorporating them into critical roles, and then we let them go when their contract expires.

Communication in the department was terrible under previous management, and is better now, but still not great. There is still intense fear of losing one's job, even among full time employees. There is still enormous ambiguity around the most recent initiative to reorganize and simplify. And there is still a feeling that the old ""regime"" is mostly still in place.

People see that certain managers bounce around from position to completely unrelated position about every year, and they aren't leaving wild successes in their wake. At best, they seem to be average managers. What are employees supposed to think when there are free spirits who can apparently change their job whenever they feel like it, but they are always involved in high level initiatives and discussions? There is a feeling of favoritism, and if you're not on the list, you'll never make very high.

The way finances in the department are handled is messy, time consuming, and difficult. Financial information is almost always out of date, yet finance is always asking employees for more and more work to make their lives easier, rather than the other way around. We waste tons of time tracking and then approving billable hours.

The listing here on Glassdoor is terribly misleading. Every department is wildly different in how it is run and its goals and management. President Nelson has very little to do with the day-to-day work of most departments, so rating him gives a skewed impression of the workplace.

There are I'll-tempered managers, incompetent workers, back-stabbing co-workers, office politics, manipulation and more. 
After working for the company for over 23 years I've seen hard workers squeezed out only for them to be replaced with younger, temporary workers. I've seen a secretary promoted to manager without any training, only to see her continually rage at her team until one employee was continually reduced to tears.
Most jobs are spoken for before they are even listed, and that includes promotions. 
My experience with HR was a joke.
Working for ICS is different than working at the COB in Salt Lake. Pay is more competitive and the environment is more casual. 
The thought is that even though the pay is lower, the health insurance and other benefits make up for it.

I thought it would be a Zion-like society where people respected each other and it would be a healthy environment. Some departments are great but I wasn't in a healthy dept and I met other people who also experienced trauma, psychological abuse and sexual harassment in different departments. I was gaslighted and sexually harassed within my group, and my coworkers often would joke about being able to get rid of people if they didn't like them. So I was afraid to say anything, I couldn't afford to lose my job.  I have never in any job experienced the level of toxicity I did in that job. My coworkers destroyed others everyday, they made everyone look bad to upper management and shifted the blame to others whenever they could. I tried to tell management what was happening but my team would come back and blame me and say its my problem and to deal with it. It was such an abusive environment. I also feel bad for my friends in other departments who experienced horrible trauma, one even said working for the church was a lot worse than going through divorce.

Also, management often doesn't to want to hear input, and it is insanely difficult to get paid even the average/normal wage for your skill sets. Its frustrating to hear you get blessed in other ways for taking a steep pay cut while you're struggling to make ends meet. 

People often don't like talking about these events at the church office because it often affects others negatively and impacts their view of the church, but this isn't uncommon.

709,The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,Abusive Managers in Temple Department,2016-12-20,1.0,Temple Department Area Manager,"Great Benefits
Under the right manager it would be a great environment","Poor Pay - Lived paycheck to paycheck. Had very abusive managers and worked daily in a hostile work environment. Abuse in LDS Church Employment is real, many people don't think abuse can happen when employed by a church. I was forced out by my abusers and the abusers were protected by the legal team and still have their jobs. I had 8 years of ""exceeds"" and ""greatly exceeds"" (BYU + Church Employment) yet after 9 days at a new job at the Temple Department my job was threatened by an abusive manager and he made good on his threats to terminate me. I was a whistle blower and got forced out. I can't provide details here but use a search engine to search for ""Abuse in LDS Employment"" and you will find my blog where you can get full details and then make up your own mind. Employment by the church was the worst employment experience in my life and it should have been the best. I still believe the church is true despite what I went through. I wrote the HR Department, Temple Department, and General Authorities and all ignored me multiple times. They won't even respond to my letters despite the abuse I suffered and the evidence I presented. It was really shocking and incredibly unbelievable that they would ignore such damning facts about their managers. After 10 years I am still in shock. Abuse occurred as an employee of a temple and as an employee in the Temple Department. I learned the hard way that Church Employment does not care about their employees - I was used, abused, and then discarded. I resigned before they could fire me because I was ""not a good fit"". I pressed my manager hard when he came in to inform me that I was being let go because I was not a good fit and he said my work was excellent and there were no problems with me as an employee or my work - and I recorded it. Interestingly, when I appealed they suddenly found reasons for my termination. That shows a severe lack of integrity but it's legal - they can fire you for no reason and get away with it. And, they did. Just be warned church employment is not always blissful. I went through years of hell under abusive and powerful men and the Church Employment has shown they do not care it happened."

There seemed to be endless levels of bureaucracy at times that prevented much work from being done. I also saw many inefficiencies and wastes of money, nothing uncommon to any large organization, but difficult to watch nonetheless because it's the widow's mite. Also, like elsewhere in the world, you will run into dishonest people, and people too full of pride to admit when they are wrong. One of the commons problems was with people up and down the management chain trying much harder to please their superiors than to delight the millions of people who actually use their products and services.

Workplace bullying and harassment is an issue and is not taken seriously enough. The bullies and harassers are allowed to stay on because it's so difficult to fire people, while those who are bullied (women) end up quitting to get away from the bullies. 
Telecommuting is technically against company policy, but some employees were allowed to do it all the time whereas others were only occasionally allowed to do it and still others were not allowed to at all. This needs to be allowed on a fair and reasonable basis.

Last but not the least, I really liked working with people who shared the same values as me.","There are so many more downsides than there are pros. First, there are no opportunities for advancement.  I've been here for almost five years and I'm in the same position as when I started and it's not like I don't try. I've applied many, many times. Second, the corporate culture is something to frown upon. If you don't fit the typical Utah Mormon mold, best of luck to you.  Prepare for some scrutiny. There's no professional development here. Also, they don't offer any onsite perks. You just work, work, work, work, and work. Management also never shows appreciation for their employees. There is NO autonomy and you are not allowed to make your own decisions. Your breaks are timed and if you go over just ONE MINUTE, you'll be reported. If you go on the internet while on your shift, you will be reported. They also keep track of how much time you spend off the phones. If you're not busy enough, they'll give you a ""Subject Matter Expert TASK"" like training other people, doing quality assurance on calls, writing instructions (technical writing) but for no additional pay. BUT, taking calls is your FIRST priority. There is no sort of flexibility in your schedule. You are expected to live and breathe work. 

There's an overwhelming amount of things to do on a day-to-day basis.

But perhaps the most disappointing thing about this place is, they don't practice what they preach. Employees are expected to treat work like church and are expected to ""lead like the savior,"" but management treats us all like we're disposable. The turnover here is quite high, because if you had other options, why would you stay in a place that makes you feel like you're nothing? The people who end up staying are those who have no other choice. This place doesn't tend to keep ""the best"" talent. Instead, it tends to keep those who have nowhere else to go--which says a lot about the corporate culture they've cultivated here."

There is an strong internal demand for IT services and a wide variety of modern technologies deployed to meet them. There are many challenges but if you keep a positive attitude you will grow in amazing ways. Training is available and valued.","Currently the HR function in ICS is totalitarian and is creating an atmosphere of fear, distrust, and nearly a hostile work environment. Truly unfortunate, because it hasn't always been that way. Things turned bad after new HR leadership arrived.  Also heavily reliant on contract labor, which unfortunately are limited to one-year contracts with one year option to renew. These ""contingents"" can sometimes be unintentional treated as second-class citizens, which can be demoralizing. I feel bad for them. Legacy IT environments are big, complex, and enterprise architecture is nearly anarchic. The organization itself is so big and bureaucratic that change can be excruciatingly slow and political landmines are everywhere, just like any big organization. Since open hostility is not well tolerated in the Church culture, passive aggressiveness is common.  There is very little upward mobility, attrition in the top IT management is very low, and moderate in the middle management, which is telling. Attrition of top technical talent is also a big issue as the local job market has heated up."

If you are a yes-man, never want to question ""authority"", and you really like those short feel-good church propaganda videos, then you will probably enjoy it here and most likely thrive.","-Very political and hostile environment where everyone has their own agenda and are not afraid to back stab. 
-Terrible leadership that definitely does not practice what they preach. 
-A lot of judging among peers and people are very unfriendly towards each other.  
-Very little vacation time. 
-Mandatory shutdowns where you have to use 8 or 9 of your 12 annual vacation days on certain times of the year when they choose.
-Not very much trust and delegation, but a whole lot of micro-managing. 
-Nobody follows the HR policies.
-Sometimes your job is treated like a job and other times its treated like a church calling depending on what they want from you.  
-You will get thrown into a new assignment or job with no training or pay raise and are expected to perform like you are a trained professional.
-Poor communication all around.  
-A lot of unethical people doing unethical things, which is very shocking when you expect working for the church to be a spiritual experience.  
-Lack of integrity in the way things are done. 
-Most people I know here don't really enjoy their jobs but everyone is afraid to speak up because of how they have treated others who have done so before.
-Because it is a church run business, people won't speak up or verbally oppose leadership because it is seen as opposing the church itself, so people can get away with a lot. 
-The lunch room is like a prison where everyone is divided up into their ethnicity ""gangs"". 
-Expectations are too high for the amount you are paid. 
-A lot of blaming others instead of taking responsibility.
-If you give your opposing opinion, people are not afraid to turn on you on a dime with no compassion or love.  
-No job security, since they will change things around in an instant with no explanation or reason.
-Leadership says they want feedback but they rarely really do. If you just agree and say yes all the time you will go far here.  
-All in all it's just a very uncomfortable environment."

I've never cried at work until I came to this place. Working here has truly taken away my faith in humanity. Here's why:

1) They micromanage you TO THE BONE! I'm talking, we have daily ""priority"" checklists. PLUS, we are required to report an hourly breakdown of our days.
2) If you go over your break by a minute, you'll be told that if that happens again--it will be reported to HR
3) toxic work environment
2) crappy hours
3) non-responsive HR. I can't go into details here. but so many things have been reported and they did NOTHING.
4) management's unwillingness to work with your school schedule. if you're a student, forget this place. you'll never be done with your degree! Then, you'll be stuck here forever. (I've seen it happen...)
5) You'll be taken advantage of. And let me elaborate--you're hired as a customer service representative but they give you ""Subject Matter Expert tasks."" That means, you could be writing knowledge base articles, doing quality assurance for calls, training new people. And all of that for NO pay increase. 
6) They will bombard you with things to do. So many things to do--all the time! And when you don't do them, management sends out nasty emails about you wasting the lord's money.

The benefits are excellent; you'd be hard pressed to find across the board benefits as rich.  

The monetary compensation is typically low market although there are some exceptions.  The salaries are more competitive with entry level people and grow a pretty sizable delta with more experienced hires.","I wouldn't work in ICS (Information and Communications Services) no matter what right now.  The environment of the whole group, especially in HR is pretty toxic.  HR drives many of the decisions both overtly and behind the scenes and they aren't that savvy to be able to do that. They seem way more interested in their own power and legacy than doing what is best for the business.   They make it pretty obvious they have the power to fire individuals or reorg the group at their whim and even leadership is afraid to challenge them.  As a result the directors often seem uncertain or schizophrenic in their decisions.  It is extraordinarily political and often who you know and are friends with is more important than what you can do.  It is pretty clear to most that employees are viewed as a commodity that can be discarded or at least have their role minimized at a moment's notice.

Outside of that one department, I believe the management to be much more open to different ideas and supportive of individual success.

Generally in the whole Church, it is extraordinarily difficult to get a raise or promotion outside of the typical cost of living increase each year.  (They do call it a merit increase, but it seems to have little to do with merit.)"

Great food in the cafeteria.,My manager was very lazy and never improved over the 8 years I worked there. I worked at a position that was open 24 hours 7 days a week. The monthly schedule was always a week late coming out for the month currently working. If there was a Holiday that month you just had to wait and see if you were on the schedule. There was also a lot of office problems between co workers that the manager never dealt with. I felt like the manager wasn't always honest.
981,The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,A great place to work if you are family guy and dont mind getting payed less.,2013-08-02,5.0,Software Engineer,You don't work as many hours as other places.

Great work-life balance. Compensation in I.T. jobs is about average with the industry.

In the tech space, the Church has come a long way over the past 5 years.","Most tech opportunities center around the Church offices in Riverton, UT or in Salt Lake City. Non-profit culture can be a bit slow."

It is a rather nice environment and the people are friendly.","They no longer offer full time positions, so if you are looking to work here and eventually get benefits you might want to go somewhere else.

You know what you are working on is contributing to either a humanitarian or ecclesiastical cause, which is a great feeling.

The IT Department at the Church (the department I worked for) does a good job at staying on top of technology.  They are typically quick to adopt trends early on.

The work environment is awesome.  It may put off some, but I liked starting the work day in prayer with my co-workers.  It infused us with unity and purpose that can't be manufactured through traditional team-building exercises (we did those, too, though!).","The Church struggles to remain market competitive for IT staff.  My pay started out great, but it did not increase like it does in a for-profit company.  (That is not why I left, mind you.  They definitely take care of their employees.)

The load is a bit lighter than the average IT job.  This might be a good thing for you, but for me it was sometimes a little nerve-wracking to *not* be under the gun every now and again."

1001,The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,Senior Engineer,2012-11-14,4.0,Senior Engineer,While there are negatives there are positives as well.  The environment is surprisingly very professional. Another plus are the retirement and medical benefits.,There are limited opportunities for career growth.

Also has fitness center, bike room, recording room, and flex schedule. Work aligns with sense of purpose, and colleagues with similar values adds to comfortable working environment. If you're driven, you can do almost anything to align your passion with your work.","Siloed departments, no enterprise authoring strategy, not enough tech writers per IT personnel. At times feels like a start-up due to autonomy given to individual groups. Has incredible potential but seems hindered by lack of coordination among various groups. It's a large organization, and has similar challenges as other large organizations."

Share empathy with work mates and similar life perspective and organization goals.  Pleasant human enviroment.,Low salaries for a place with a high inflation but not recognized by the government.  Rate inflation is disguised in an institutional manner showing only half of real rate of inflation. Our organization does not want to recognize this real fact; a fact it's not under our controll
1007,The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,Best place to work ever,2012-09-25,5.0,Administrative Assistant,Everyone that works here is concerned with serving the Lord - not about making the most money. It is nice to work somewhere where everyone has the same values and can really focus on work and not worry about offending others. Policy decisions have all been approved by senior church leaders so there isn't too much pushback. The benefits are great and most people are wonderful to work with.,"Not everyone is as driven as I would hope them to be.  There are some people who work there who are probably replacable, but because they have been there for a certain amount of time they company endures having them even when their work is not up to par. Though probably the right thing to do - it makes it hard on others at times. Working for the Church and the Church are separate."

Working with these professionals towards a common goal is very rewarding.  The pay is good depending on experience, benefits are great and the dress code is business casual.","The lackadaisical HR department is the biggest con.  Promotions for engineers are rare, random and it is common knowledge that leaving and coming back is the only direct route for obtaining the next career level.  That is true unless you take the management route, which does have a career path with frequent promotions caused by reorganization opportunities."
