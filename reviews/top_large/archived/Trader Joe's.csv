- Most of the Mate's (managers) stated where you were, so have good insight on how to deal with most issues. For the most part this means they will treat you with respect.
- Culturally and Identity responsible. Meaning (My experience) they are understanding of however you choose to live your life.","- Although starting pay can vary (17.50, in my area), you are not appropriately compensated for the value you bring. It's basically a Pass/Fail system and you can only receive the caped amount when it comes to compensation.
- If you let them, they will work you to the bone. If you have a driven work ethic, they will use that and never think twice about you burning out. Stay away if you are a ""Grinder"", you'd be better off with a job that rewards that work ethic.
- Most ppl say the benefits, but to be honest its, it's just a bit better then the next retail/grocery store. Does not live up to real world standards.
- The fake""corporate care""s and is your friend kool-aid you are expected to ingest and believe in. They have shown their colors by making record profits these past two years and still want to slowly take away the ""Great"" benefits and 401k matching, just to make even more money."

I was only 1 out of the 6 black employees there, so most times I was only 1 of 2 on the days I worked. I felt very out of place a lot of times and regardless of how we got along, there was always a feeling of distance."
249,Trader Joe's,Great Company,2022-02-16,4.0,Crew Member,Great Benefits package for employees and their families,"Standing on feet all day. Lifting, twisting."
250,Trader Joe's,Great benefits,2022-02-16,4.0,Crew Member,"Quarterly raises, 401k, Paid Vacation time, Health Insurance, some gym memberships covered by health insurance. Positive Friendly work environment, highest paying grocery store with room for growing, use of Dayforce app, lets employees pick up extra shifts, or have shifts picked up, very flexible hours, they hire genuinely good hearted, and down to earth individuals.","Customer Service, Sometimes the customers can really get under your skin.. especially if your an attractive female. (but to be fair my mates did a great job of recognizing these kinds of issues, and helping the employees get out of these uncomfortable situations). 3 strikes and your out rule, Trader joes has a rule that if you fail 3 quarterly reviews you automatically get terminated. I never found this fair because sometimes extremely competent workers would be fired for ""not upholding Trader Joes standards"" and from what I've witnessed they can literally put anything in that category from not smiling enough to not enrolling in store politics. Sometimes it can feel clicky... which can be annoying. Oh and no overtime."
251,Trader Joe's,Company really doesn't care,2022-03-09,1.0,Crew Member,Mates and Captain MAY be cool if you're lucky and get a good location,"The company does a lot of smoke and mirrors, ""yeah we're cool we pay a competitive rate and lowered our health insurance hours."" Sure, you can work 28 hours a week to get health insurance, but that means you can't miss more than four days a week and if you do you're scrambling to make it up. How if you're working an internship? Or a second job and they don't provide health insurance? Or you can't afford out of pocket? There are so many conditions upon which the company's supposed generosity and kindness to crew completely fall apart. The pay is competitive, but is it adequate overall? How if you live in a city with an increasing cost of living? I live in Brooklyn, have worked there for four years and make 20/hr. Could that cover my living expenses? Of course, I need a new job obviously, but can I afford to work less to make more financial risks to find a better job with the rent being so high and needing health care? 

They also recently changed 401 k contributions and even Mates are upset. The company got rid of hazard pay, but we're still masks, and why are we wearing masks? Because there's a virus that's killed nearly 1 million people in this country alone. Even though there is a vaccine, people can still catch covid when vaccinated. The severity varies, but that's besides the point. It's still a HAZARD so we should still be getting hazard pay. And how if someone has family members who can't get vaccinated because of pre existing health conditions? They should just be doomed to dying by covid? It's not a hazard for us to potentially bring covid home to our FAMILIES??? I wonder how many crew members who lost family members because they brought it home and weren't aware before masks were implemented because there was a time in the pandemic where we didn't think masks worked, and stores were telling crew members to not wear masks or gloves to not scare the customers. Oh but the company says, ""no bureaucracy. every store makes its own rules."" That's awfully convienent, isn't it? The company doesn't have to take any responsibility then. Well, if the stores make their own rules, do they make their own rules about health insurance? Attendance? How long you have to work to still be considered an employee? Whether you can take a paid leave of absence? No? Then the company is bureaucratic. 

Captains will tell you the company can't afford to give everyone hazard pay. Really? A company that's worth billions of dollars owned by a family that's worth billions of dollars and keeps opening up stores and all the costs entailed with that all around the country can't afford to pay its workers more? Can't afford to increase the pay of veteran workers in conjunction with increased pay offers for new employees? Really? 1 millions seconds is 11.5 days. 1 billion seconds is 31.5 years. Really? They can't afford it? That's not true. It's a bold face lie. 

It's stuff like that and the company has this insane anti-union rhetoric where they'll say union dues are like hundreds of dollars a month. Are you kidding me? It's like twenty bucks. 

Also, this is just a wacky fact you can find easily on wikipedia, but the company is owned by Aldi's, who is owned by the Albrecht family, who were Nazis in WW2 and you know, it's funny. I once asked why there weren't ever any hannukah decorations in our store and my captain told me the company didn't want to recognize any religious holiday, despite there being obvious Christmas decorations. Huh, kinda weird yeah?

This is a company that LIES it lies to its crew, captains, and mates who without it the company wouldn't exist. But it lies on the preface that they know we are expendable. At the end of the day the negligence and passive cruelty is enacted on the fact that we are expendable and they know if we get fired, quiet, get seriously hurt, they can replace us.

The company prides itself on diversity by hiring black mates and captains. Ok, but the majority of your crew is black and brown people. And we've already discussed pay and health care make it difficult to pursue greater opportunities. The scholarship the company offers is meager. So if you put marginalized people in positions of power within the company but don't do anything to MEANINGFULLY improve the living conditions of your marginalized employees, do you really care? No. 

The PR team for this company is bullish and uses intentionally vague language like, ""our employees are diverse, pay is competitive, each store makes its own rules, our health insurance is great,"" and rely on the fact that journalists don't care enough to actually scrutinize what they're saying. Which is sad, because it doesn't take a great stretch of the imagination to see that this company believes in only one thing and that's the almighty dollar."

It was decent, thorough training, and a good experience of working in a grocery store. Crew does everything from cashier, to stocking shelves, to customer service, to before and after hours cleaning. Fun people to work with, most employees have a great work ethic and watch out for one another. It can be very physical work; I dropped 17 pounds in 3 months, (intentional), and actually improved my physical strength. The compensation was reasonable, and we were given additional money during the pandemic, as well as occasional bonuses, gift cards, and a nice little employee discount. I enjoyed my experience and would have stayed had my old job not called me back.","They are sticklers for accurate time keeping, as you have to be ON THE FLOOR and working when you clock in. You can't clock in and put your coat away - so plan on going in at least 5-10 minutes early to get yourself together.

They are extremely flexible with personal schedules and are one of the few companies offering a livable wage to their employees. The company is also huge on promoting from within which creates a great work culture because most managers and supervisors have been in your position before.,I honestly can't think of any cons working at Trader Joe's.

379,Trader Joe's,Get a better review system,2022-01-23,3.0,Mate,"Good reasons to work for TJs are that alot of stores have allowed mates to put their heads together and comprise a schedule that works for everyone while also covering the store. They also got rid of the mandatory OT and allow some mates to only work 40 hours. Overall, it's fun to have the discretion to do whatever it takes to make the customer happy.","Raises and bonuses are based on reviews from staff that basically act as popularity contests not actual tests of management skills. Managers are afraid to rub staff the wrong way or question them due to fear of getting a bad review. If you like to hold a high performance standard and enforce the rules, you will definitely get a bad review. 

It is also stressful when there is up to 8 different mates with 8 different ways of managing. You get alot of ""well, so and so said I could"" or ""So and So never asks us to do that"" ""So and so lets me take extra breaks"" etc etc etc."

386,Trader Joe's,Great to learn but not a forever job,2022-01-27,2.0,Assistant Manager,"You learn a lot about all aspects of the store
You strengthen your communication skills
You strengthen leadership skills 
Your day is busy and never the same
You learn to excel in customer service","Your experience and learning is dependent on if your captain likes you or your regional likes you. That can change quickly and without warning.
Demanding hours that are not flexible and not ideal for anyone with a family. 9 hour shifts that are in a waterfall without much flexibility. If you ask for flexibility it's marked against you as not working for the store needs.
Not a lot of opportunity to seek out professional development. You get two classes from TJ University and that's it. Seeking other development is looked down upon, especially if you ask for time off.
Promotions are made souly on if you are well liked by the captain and regional. I worked with great Mates who were never going to get a store just because the upper management didn't like them and crew didn't find them ""cool enough"".
Your review and promotions are heavily dependent in the crew reviews which becomes a popularity contest. If you have rules or boundaries and hold everyone accountable by them you'll get marked down from the crew. Some mates let things slide and some don't. This leads to inconsistencies among the management which can't be fixed. 
Most importantly, every mate gets told they are a shining star and will get their promotion but it's not true. It's a well hidden fact that some will never be promoted and there's no reason other than your just not liked enough. This in return causes a toxic environment among the management team. Everyone is looking out for their promotion and don't collaborate, share responsibility, or support each other.
Even though your management your required to work as a crew member for whatever the need is. Which in itself is a good idea to build morale and learn. However, that comes first before your management responsibilities and they don't allow overtime for catching up on those responsibilities. It's a damned if you do damnded if you don't scenario that you can't win.
You aren't allowed to be honest and tell crew when they're not performing and when they want promotions. You're never allowed to say ""you aren't being seen for a promtion"" because it's all a popularity game. There's no reason other than if you're liked by captain and regional for promotion to mate. It's hard to give hope to 90% when you know that it's not going to happen."

Even the customers are typically nicer than you’d find in other retail environments.,The pandemic really put into perspective how much the company cares about you - which is not very much.

Flexible schedules, especially after you have stayed with the company for a while.
We have the opportunity to give anonymous reviews about management, and to make suggestions for improvement. Not many jobs give this opportunity to their employees.","It would be nice if the hourly pay was a little higher, but having a flexible schedule, health benefits, and a 20% discount on food purchases over $20 is the trade off."
452,Trader Joe's,The mates and captain can make or break morale.,2022-01-08,3.0,Crew Member,"Good food, nice customers, fun work environment IF you work at a good location, and you can try foods w/o paying IF you work at a location that allows it. Most did, but my second location didn't because management were mean and money hungry.","I worked at two different locations in the same city. At the first one, the mates and captains were kind, funny, chill, and amiable. At the second one, the mates and captain were awkward, fake, and rude. There's generally comraderie amongst the crew regardless of the mates and captains, but if yours were horrendous like mine were, they may make it so you can hardly talk to your coworkers without getting in trouble. My advice is to shop at the location you wish to work for and ask the crew that's ringing you up if this is a good location to work at; avoid asking older employees because they've most likely been there for 10-15 years and have no plans to move up or leave the company and are extremely loyal to people who genuinely just see them as work horses. Ask young people. The younger the better.

 We had our captain and mates bragging about sales during a PANDEMIC while we, the crew, were the ones interacting with customers, soothing their panic, trying to gently tell them to give us 6ft distance, and more. Like, of course sales were good, it's a grocery store operating during a pandemic where people are scared for their health, their lives, their jobs, and their futures. Not really the time to be gloating.

We also were told we couldn't wear GLOVES, let alone masks, until well into the pandemic. We were told we couldn't come in if we wanted to wear masks or gloves, and this is information you can look up. They also tried to suppress information about employees getting COVID until they couldn't anymore (AKA, until it was too obvious to ignore how many crew members were missing/out sick). 

Also, for women, watch out for male upper management who want to, uh, blur the lines between what's appropriate and what's inappropriate in work relationships."

- Corporate decisions during the pandemic led to massive numbers of preventable, crew illness and some deaths
- CEO would rather nickle and dime the staff to make himself richer
- The company used to have a promote from within viewpoint, so now store level management is full of poorly educated white men who are complacent, lazy, and often sexist and racist. They are not trained as managers but act like tiny dictators. 
- Most stores have lost MANY of their mid ""career"" crew (the 3-7 year veterans) because the company pays new hires more. This will result in a long term deficit of people who were trained to care and work within the TJ system. The longer term veterans can't leave because while they feel trapped at a capped out wage, they feel like they can't do better."

I started six years ago and carried the core values in my wallet on a laminated card. I loved this company. I had a selfie with the ceo and sent the VP of operations a personalized coffee mug. When I left last November I've never felt so devalued. They transfer problems around - so if another manager sexually harasses someone - transferred. Many captains have been with the company forever and are problems but they keep them because it is too hard to fire people - transfer! During the pandemic I've never worked so hard and protected my crew and the customers. I put my life on the line for all of them - we struggled with chemical management- conflicting information from corporate about what sanitizers to use - meanwhile my crew got burns to their hands, using chemicals which were meant for surfaces rather than hands. We had to manage crazy maskless antivaxxers - one who I had to call the police 12! Times and corporate told me to ""just do a citizens arrest"" instead of me begging to get a restraining order, also the police were begging us to get a restraining order - but corporate wouldn't support that (the optics!). I finally had enough when a fellow manager got transferred to another store after the second time of being accused (and found guilty) of sexual harassment. He got to keep his pay and was demoted. He made more than me and it to be demoted - because it's just way too hard to fire someone. This company used to be full of integrity (number one core value) but they don't care about their employees - they care about the bottom line. $$$ and their image.

574,Trader Joe's,Not worth it in the long haul,2022-01-10,1.0,Crew Member,Dental vision and free gym memberships,All of the people getting trained are getting paid more than the ones that have been there for 4 years! They started cutting hours to the loyal crew members and are trying to find ways to get rid of them without firing them (verbal abuse). The captain at my store has the openers come in at 4:30 instead of 4 so he has more money in his pocket and doesn’t give the store the supplies they need so he can get his bonus
575,Trader Joe's,Went from cool job to depressing and greedy and mismanaged,2022-01-05,1.0,Crew Member,Generally your coworkers are nice when they don’t have to compete for hours. Store discount and food is pretty good. Used to have decent benefits but have gone downhill and are more difficult to keep and receive.,"Trader Joe’s has taken a tumble the last few years and if you sit and read through many recent reviews on various sites you’ll see the same phrases repeated like bad management, favoritism, sexism and racism! All very true! Of course not all management across all stores can be bad but those who are more recently being promoted up the chain especially to captain seem to do so through that favoritism & sexism more and more! And once you are placed in a management position it’s hard to be fired, you can do no wrong no matter how many complaints they get! As long as these new captains cut labor cut insurance and keep hiring at starting wage keeping them $$$ rolling in nothing else matters. 

Some more proof of change and not for the better, five years ago if you walked into almost any Trader Joe’s (unless just opened?) and asked how long all the employees had been with the company it seemed everyone kept this job and many would say years! When I first started the majority had been with the store since opening or even before transferring from elsewhere which was a comforting feeling like you have something stable. They also put more energy and effort into training because hey it’s for the long haul. That is not the case today I dare you walk into any Trader Joe’s and ask employees, more and more are new hires mostly because the changes have become unbearable. 

Another reoccurring statement you hear is not getting paid for extra work which is incredibly true! You have section leaders and order writers that don’t have any benefits other than more work and possibly more stable hours but even that is in question. If your desire is to move up in the company then I supposed that is expected of you to try your hand at the orders, yet there are many I’ve seen that are great at their job so continue to be made/asked to be an order writer some that even do desire to move up in the company but hey back to that favoritism will never be promoted. There have been several times at my store recently it was difficult to find people to be order writers for this reason. And since you can’t force a crew member to take on an order they were hiring more newbies (while simultaneously cutting hours and claiming not enough work to go around??) just to write the orders which has led to some serious under and over ordering of products due to inexperience or lack of care.

Now COVIDWISE. The store briefly had hazard pay and we’re more lenient on absences due to sickness. Yet that’s all gone! All the while more crew are sick than ever and still coming to work even when ill because they can’t afford not to with the little hours they are getting not to mention trying to keep insurance since that’s a balancing act all on your own. They have taken down all plexiglass and all forms of covid precautions including not enforcing masks. Another thing that was bothersome early on in the pandemic Trader Joe’s was one of the last companies/ grocery stores who did anything about covid even though majority of employees were voicing concern. They seem like a more liberal and inclusive company but that is no longer true. Corporate corporate corporate is the new name of the game.

Another thing about management. There are some that are always gone! The benefits you get at the top in terms of paid time AR and more are very generous. At my store current captain is on “vacation” at least once a month for days or weeks at a time! And when you have newer mates they don’t want to make decisions or don’t feel comfortable a lot more falls through the cracks. I know majority of the mates are frustrated by this but are afraid to speak up and especially when making the schedule captain has final say and reviews the schedule so it’s hard to work with crew on any changes when the person who gives the okay is gone for 10 days at a time frequently! I don’t get how this works and is okay??

There’s so much more that could be said. But truth is if they don’t make some major changes soon nobody will recognize Trader Joe’s as the friendly great products great Custer service and great values small neighborhood community driven store. Even as a customer in my store or others the vibe the customer service and that special something that made shopping a unique fun time is gone. I know grocery stores and the service industry in general are not the most fun to be right now but go in to any of the 6 competing grocery stores down the road and I’m greeted with more smiles and better energy than any Trader Joe’s right now and that just makes me sad as it was a stand out working there. 

And to all those writing 5star reviews recently; I know you feel grateful to have a job and some security and it may be better than your last awful job but they are anti union anti change just like most in charge in this world today are feeding you just enough to stay “happy” or feel desired or accepted when in reality you don’t matter to them. I had a captain tell me and overhear say to others more than once “well sorry if that bothers you…sorry you think we should be helping more…sorry can’t give more hours…sorry I know it’s frustrating… but in the end I can always hire new people the company has a good reputation we will always find someone to do it some newbie to hire the company will always be fine no matter how many of you have issue. “

This mentality needs to go!"
576,Trader Joe's,"Great benefits, mediocre coworkers",2021-12-15,3.0,Crew Member,"- Benefits are off-the-charts amazing. 20% discount, 10% 401k contribution, and 90% employer-paid medical/dental/vision that costs me about $90/month for a $500 deductible and $20 copay on nearly everything. 
- They allow a very flexible schedule with consistent hours and regular days off, are very understanding and generous with unpaid time off, and allow a moderate amount of paid time off. It is an amazing schedule for a retail job.
- It /can/ be stress free if you make it that way.","- There is a very strange dichotomy between shifts. Morning crew (4:30am-1pm) is extremely conservative. The evening crew (2-10PM) is mostly college kids and is much more liberal. I've had some problems with the morning crew being racist, misogynist, and creepy AF.
- Management can be apathetic. If you're a rigid person with high standards it can be difficult to accept how laid back they are. For example, I wrote the order for one section and on my days off they assigned people to the section that I had big problems with and I was unable to get them to change.
- Maybe this is a service industry thing but sexual misconduct and misogyny is rampant. In the year I've been there, multiple supervisors and crewmembers have been fired for sexual misconduct. I reported several incidents to the general manager and it was ignored because it turns out that he's a personal friend of the person I reported. Out of the ~30 female coworkers I'm friends with, every single one has complained of sexual harassment from other coworkers and customers.
- This is a very physical job. I've had to start physical therapy to deal with the back pain sustained from working here. Thankfully the benefits cover everything but the $20 copay."

As a crew member, you are guaranteed $1.20-$1.50 raise per year unless you royally mess up. As a mate, even if you work extremely hard all year, it is extremely rare to get a $2 raise.

I'm no longer an employee and as a customer, I'm not greeted often and employees are engaged more in personal dialect between themselves rather than customer-focused. This is part of the reason I left. I used to love coming to work because it felt like family, and eventually it started to feel like just a job. This influence came directly from management and it was very clear their focus changed. Managers changed from acting like mentors to acting like a boss.

678,Trader Joe's,Trader Joe's- Good as long as you don't take on too much responsibility,2021-11-20,3.0,Crew Member,"Flexibility, great benefits and overall as much responsibility as you'd like. Raises every 6 moths that are pretty easy to get as long as you're punctual and don't have any write ups. Store culture greatly depends on your region/captain management but in my experience TJs is pretty good at hiring cool, friendly people who make work enjoyable.
This is a great option for people who have other responsibilities. Once you've been hired and proven to be reliable, they're usually really accommodating with any schedule changes and time off requests as long as they're submitted prior to scheduling.","Roles with significantly more responsibility, skill and effort are not reflected in pay. So someone in charge of ordering for a section, directly contributing to store sales does not get paid more than someone who does the bare minimum. And in some cases, may even be getting paid less since Traders has a tendency to hire in new crew members at ""competitive rates"". 
So a 17 year old in high school who works a few days a weeks in some cases may get paid more an hour than someone who's been with the company for 5+ years and writes an order. This is dependent on region and captain, but something that has been an issue since I've started with the company.

The only real benefits of taking on order writing responsibilities is 1) part of the path if you're interested in be coming a mate 2) broaden your TJs skills to apply to better jobs 3) possibly strengthening your chances of qualifying for a yearly bonus that's a few hundred dollars (if you have a large order/are well liked)"

754,Trader Joe's,"Great Customer Community, Toxic Workplace for Crew",2021-11-07,2.0,Crew Member,Good pay. Flexible hours. Room for growth within the company in whichever direction you desire. Fun workplace. Family atmosphere.,"Managers play favorites heavily. 
""Family atmosphere"" is great until it's not; many workers and managers pretend to care for each other but then turn on one another if work is interfered with even slightly. Concurrently, managers will claim to be understanding of whatever situations influence your work in the moment, then punish you for those same things when reviews come around. 
Additionally, that family does not maintain much stability: Captains rotate often, mates move often (many times because of the captain's preference), and crew transfer a lot as well, you can find yourself working with a whole new ""family"" every year. 
While there are many ways to rise within the company, there are also smaller ways to get bigger roles within the position you are at (ie writing the order for a section(s) in the store), however they do not increase your pay for taking on these roles; in short, it is very easy to find yourself overpaid and underworked in that job.
The pay makes it tolerable to a limit but they know how to push you far beyond whatever you thought that limit originally was."

The crew members there are the only thing that kept me with the company for 6 years. Literally, truly, and honestly.","I was subject to managers who were ultimately discriminatory to my disability, race, and gender. It took 2 weeks to put in my ADA accommodation requests because my captain went on vacation and then personally blamed me for not taking care of the papers I handed to her. Another manager would repeatedly push me, shove things out of my hand, or make things harder to reach. I had to ask him not to because of neuropathy pain MULTIPLE times until I had to bring it up to his manager.

I spent 8 months being harassed by a male customer and management only intervened when the same man followed two female customers all around the store AND THEN to their car. 

A coworker who sexually harassed me and SEVERAL other women at the Sammamish store was unable to be fired because ""the store is so small we decided to handle it internally...which led us to not have any paperwork."" Ultimately the harasser was transferred to another Trader Joe's where he was then FIRED by the manager there for sexually harassing female coworkers.

Dozens on dozens of unfiled incident reports. Customers who repeatedly come in to sexually harass us or say racist remarks are not banned from shopping since ""they never directed those words AT you"".

Mishandling of labor hours. Over the course of a year we'd be asked to come in hours later, take 45-90 minute lunches or more, and would often leave between 12am to 2am because of how poorly the staffing and labor hours were. Our closing shifts would start at 3pm and we'd stay well past 12am most nights.

At a sister store the management chose to WRITE UP a crew member for a no-call no-show. The same crew member who attempted suicide. My dear friend who tried to intervene in the obvious disgusting issue faced HORRIFIC retaliation to the point of panic attacks.

The company and especially the managers at store level have favorites and are very very open with the kind of communication they give off that reinforces this. A personal gift I gave one of the managers who did treat me with kindness at the Sammamish store ended up having the gift scribbled on with permanent marker and then thrown away by two different managers.

I would be reprimanded on the sales floor in front of customers and coworkers and was repeatedly gaslit of company policies I'd explain to customers with a specific manager. I would have to reconfirm with the manager above him that I was indeed correct and to continue what I was initially doing and what I was trained to what company policy stands.

Additionally MULTIPLE STORES had captains FAILING to adhere to ANY cleaning procedures. This left many crew members feeling left vulnerable and unfortunately with no company guidance many developed rashes due to misuse of cleaning products."

It also seems every time they give us something, they take something. For example, every salary increase results in losing some accrued AR since they divide the hours by the dollar amount earned per hour, They gave us a temporary $4 per hour hazard pay and then said the next review period would have no raises, and then they started cutting our hours by 1 or more days a week. They said everyone would get a $.50 to $1 hour raise (long timers got .50, new people got $1, and then they increased our health insurance. AR time is very, very slow to acrew."

If you show some sense and intelligence, they ask you to take on the responsibility of ordering for a section of the store. They play on one's ego and string you along.

-If you work with the right group of people, it can be fun and you'll feel supported, like part of a team","-Typical corporate retail pitfalls: small but impactful number of rude, entitled, and clueless customers; catty store politics and co-workers drunk on tiny amounts of power; high turnover means good systems are rarely in place for long; etc.
-Decentralized leadership structure/lean staffing at store level means HR always keeps you at an arms length. Sometimes it's unclear who's in charge during uncertain times
-Corporate was slow to implement COVID safety measures and quick to phase them out, and quick to reprimand crew who spoke up. (Plus they sent an anti-union letter out to employees in the middle of the pandemic despite there being no formal threat--a sign of where their real intentions lie)
-Few opportunities for advancement, and the ones that are available are rarely attractive unless you have a clear path to becoming a store manager
-Culture/co-workers/customers vary *a lot* from store to store--best to do some investigating before applying
-Work can be physically demanding. If you sustain even a minor injury you may be forced to rely on limited STD"

I also love trying new food.",The downside of working here is that new staff starts at a higher pay and the older staff that have been working for raises for years make less. Also the higher ups have had a slow and unreliable response to covid-19.
1196,Trader Joe's,Great for a retail job,2021-08-02,4.0,Crew Member,"Flexible scheduling, discount on your purchases, there's always (free) food in the back that will count as ""product knowledge"" and in my experience, I work with people of all ages, and everyone is super friendly to one another; creating an awesome work environment","cons; everyone does a little bit of everything, meaning at some point it will be your turn to do a cart run even if its raining, snowing, 90 degrees etc. Same goes for cleaning the restrooms.

-benefits and biannual pay raise 
-easy job that requires zero brain cells 
- you get multiple breaks, some even required 
-opportunity for growth","Although it seems like a fairly easy job, where you never get bored, you sure will get overwhelmed. If you’re an introvert or have social anxiety don’t even think about applying. The customers are extremely demanding (more than at a usual grocery store) because of the expectations that the company itself places on the employees. That being said, you will face rude customers, customers who will come and harass you on the job (yes, even sexually), and the managers (mates) will not care. The only thing they do care about is nagging you about bathroom breaks and hanging out with each other at “the bridge” so much that even they themselves get in trouble with the “captain”.

You also meet a lot of great people while working here.","The work environment can become toxic if you have bad management. The lax work culture perpetuates sexual harassment. I have experienced AND witnessed documented harassers work for years on end before getting let go. Worse is that if the harasser is in a management position, they will most likely transfer them to a different store. The company does not do enough to protect their employees. Beware if you work here. Document everything even if management doesn’t take you seriously."

This is far from true from what I had seen. I was being harassed by a fellow employee and in response they made my work schedule impossible to line up with the hours I had listed I was available. They basically gave me no choice but to quit. Their values proved entirely false. Also maternity leave is ridiculously short.

- One of the most enjoyable company cultures I've been in. The company gives a damn.
- They donate their food that's close to expiring instead of throwing it away, and it feels good doing that on your shift. 
- Our store let us (excluding register hour) have micro-breaks if we were feeling stressed where we can just cool down and grab a coffee for a bit. Self-care is important.
- Trader Joe's discount for all TJ stores :3 
- Customizable clothing colors and different shirt types. Able to actually express myself at work a lot more. (very long sleeved, sweater/etc)","- You may have to work nighttime shifts, though there can be some shift flexibility and they work with you.
- Still face the slow burnout of working a register but it was never PAINFUL like a lot of the other jobs I've had where they would literally make us upsell at the register.

They also have a great 401k that they contribute to as well at the end of the year. They pay better than other retailers, by a lot! They usually give a lot of hours (from my experiences) though unless you are a mate you are technically classified as part time. Despite the part time classification, I typically work five, 8 hr shifts. This comes just short of 40 hrs a week once you subtract lunches, it’s pretty close to full time and good enough for me! Plenty of room for growth as well if you work hard and the culture is to be helpful and supportive of each other with little drama; I’ve found this to be true across both locations I’ve worked at.","Few and far between. The only con I can think of is that they do look for people who can work early mornings, late nights, and weekends (due to delivery schedules). Mid day, 9-5ish shifts are coveted but you can always use paid time off (which you accumulate as you work) to get a needed day/night off."

- Pay used to be a lot better, but now it is just barely above minimum wage"
1320,Trader Joe's,Granola Dreams and Corporate Depression,2021-07-03,4.0,Freelance Copywriter,"Trader Joe's offers their employees an abundance of benefits--Health Care (including dental!), a matched Retirement plan, and the opportunity for a raise every 6 months just to name a few. Mates and Captains (general/associate managers and store manager respectively) are usually picked from crew members, and so the opportunity to rise up in the ranks and gain more responsibility is very possible. The hours offered are flexible, starting at 4 AM to midnight, depending on the location and store's hours; this flexibility works well for people working multiple jobs, students, or people who enjoy working before and after most other people are awake. Your crew (co-workers) are there to help you, and it is very easy to make lifelong friends. The camaraderie levels are high, and you will be able to laugh and feel at ease amongst your co-workers. There is also a discount on all of the delicious food that surrounds you, and in some states on the alcohol as well. The best part is that crew members are encouraged to be as well-versed on the products as possible, so expect frequent (and free) crew tastings when new products are released.","In my personal experience, Trader Joe's HR department does not handle internal cases of racism responsibly. Two of my fellow Black woman crew members were racially harassed by another, non-Black crew member, and when these incidents were reported, not only were no actions taken against the racist crew member, but the women were told to not speak of it. The racist crew member then received a raise. In another incident, a crew member was sexually harassed by a new crew member, and when she reported it to our Mates and Captain, they asked him if he did sexually harass her, and when he said no, they dropped the matter entirely. When my fellow crew member asked that she not be scheduled with him anymore, they agreed but continually scheduled her with him repeatedly. The matter was never resolved, never reported, and she felt unsafe and disregarded. When I approached my Captain and told him I needed to take one day on the weekends off (one of the store's busier days but not the busiest) for my mental and physical health, instead of compromising or accommodating my needs, my Captain told me that I needed to honor my initial availability, and that if I needed to take a day off, to consider ""moving on."" This was his not-so-kind way of saying that my needs were of no importance to him, and that I was disposable. Not only this, but his insistence that I needed to ""honor my initial availability"" went against their promise of flexible scheduling, and other crew members who were able to change their availability frequently. All of these matters could have been a result of my location's managers (some of who were the most supportive, kind, and reassuring humans I have ever met, others who were not)--but reports of racism, sexism, etc. that were perpetrated by crew members, mates, and Captains alike were repeatedly ignored by HR. While Trader Joe's crew are diverse, protection against marginalization is not a rule."

-Never really had any beef with the managers specifically although I've heard horror stories from other tj's locations
-Relaxed environment for the most part, just a lot of responsibilities to get done in short order - all day, every day","-Lots more cons than pros, speaking solely for my case

-I'm happy I quit a few years back, but in hindsight i should say that it wasn't as good as I thought it was when I first got hired, and it wasn't QUITE as bad as I thought it was before I quit and moved jobs

-Anxiety inducing amounts of shoppers at once most days, esp on weekends and other peak times

-Holidays are actual hell because they have so many seasonal products that customers can't find elsewhere - rude customers are always a thing in grocery stores, esp at Thanksgiving/all of December

-Sometimes crew members talk about other crew to mates, in my store about petty things, and since management is pretty good about trying their best to take care of employees interpersonally at least, the managers/other crew will essentially get more into your personal business than i find necessary (i.e. the ""We're a family, not just coworkers"" bull is rampant at Trader Joe's but not all stores or management are going to know how to facilitate that idea into reality)


-The environment is relaxed and they try to make things feel laid back, but y'all........ it's still a grocery store job

-Don't buy into the fact that one of the company values is ""No Beauracracy."" It's an absolute joke amongst long standing crew that TJ's is just as beauracratic as any other retail company whose main focus is making and saving money while saving face with the public, instead of mostly focusing on the people they employ

They (corporate/general managers/managers/etc) look after the company's dollar first and foremost. 

They did not/do not have a unified expectation across states and stores in terms of covid prevention and guidelines

Now (6/9/21) they are allowing vaxxed crew to go unmasked in stores during working hours, and have stopped turning maskless customers away at the door, regardless of their stated (but obviously not proven) vaccination status

They just dropped ""Thank you Pay"" which was the extra money on top of their hourlys that stuck around for a while during covid, and they also have changed rules regarding employee discounts and some things changed with benefits this year, but I am not privy to that info

Please proceed with caution, but even with all the negatives, I enjoyed parts of my time at the company, mostly thanks to peers/coworkers"

1470,Trader Joe's,A Great Place to Work,2021-05-12,5.0,Crew Member,"Trader Joe's is a fun, rewarding place to work. There's a good team atmosphere - everyone does everything, from receiving deliveries to ringing up customers to getting carts to stocking shelves. It's not the typical low-morale retail atmosphere, because you're expected to do excellent work, and you're rewarded for doing it. That means you're working with motivated people, which is a lot more fun.

The work itself is varied and interesting - you work every section of the store, though your schedule and the delivery schedule make a big difference to what you get most exposure to. I mostly did mornings, and that's when we received our wet (refrigerated) and frozen deliveries, so that's what I majored in. There's also a nice mix of people work and project work - you're doing customer service, but also working on getting sections stocked. I enjoyed doing early shifts (usually 5am-1pm or thereabouts), because it meant the first half of my day was focused on putting a section together, and then the second half was about making people happy. Trader Joe's is really customer focused, and the products are excellent, so you really do get to make people's days. That's always fun.

And the pay is good.","You usually need to be able to work very early, very late, or possibly both. You also need to be able to work in a fast-paced environment, especially around the holidays. It's physically demanding - be prepared to haul some pallets, lift heavy boxes, and load and unload full carts of groceries quickly while making pleasant chit-chat with the customer. All that takes a toll on your body. You also need to be able to handle extremely cold conditions if it's your turn to do a frozen pull - you'll be in that walk-in freezer for a while."
1471,Trader Joe's,Great place to work,2021-05-26,4.0,Crew Member,"If you love food, good company, and a relatively low stress work environment with opportunities to move up within the company- this is a great place.",Not a lot of cons.

But it puts the wants of the individual customer over the well-being of the crew members, and while they definitely care about us, it is upsetting that our management seems to be expected to hold this line instead of being able to keep out anti maskers who put us at a greater risk for infection.

It was definitely a lot of physical labor, which they let you know about. I would've been golden if I worked there part-time probably.

1690,Trader Joe's,It's got good joe,2021-03-20,5.0,Head Joe,Easy to learn everybody's name,Confusing to refer to people
1691,Trader Joe's,My coworkers are like family,2021-03-20,5.0,Crew Member,"The reason why you always see happy Crew Members at Trader Joe's is attributed to several things. First of all, there is a multi-part interview process, which determines whether they are positive, hard-working, and customer-service driven. Second, we get awesome benefits for retail. Third, I have found management to be really supportive and they try hard to do right by us and the community. 

Crew Members are caring people, and we care for each other every day. Working in retail will bring any group of people closer, but when you have such kind people in that environment, they become family. I have met some of my very best friends through work. Every store is different, but I have been in three different ones and my experiences have been overwhelmingly positive. The Mates have always cared about me. Once I was having somewhat of a bad day and I thought I was doing a great job of covering it. One of the Mates noticed and asked if I was alright, then told me I was welcome to go home early if I needed to, which I deeply appreciated. I was perfectly capable of working, but they made it clear that my mental health mattered more to them than those last few hours of work. I have always felt seen and encouraged to speak up if I need anything at all. 

Being a somewhat shy and timid person at my core, I have become more confident, more disciplined, and more passionate about the joy of food and how it plays a large role in our lives. My customer service skills are really sharp, as they encourage you to see each customer and their needs. Many customers will not notice the things we do to take care of them, but it's alright because I have always felt taken care of by the Mates and Captain. Every day I am thanked by them for doing my job, and that makes a big difference in my motivation to come in each day and improve. I was recently ""bestowed"" with a section of my very own to keep up and order for, and I am having the time of my life.

I have never felt so close to my coworkers in any other job I've had. I have best friends of all ages, of all backgrounds, even all levels of education (we have some in high school as well as people with doctorates!) It would not be easy for me to leave, and the pandemic has only made us closer.","I recognize not everyone has had this positive experience that I have had, and my speaking out about the positives is not intended to invalidate those. I recognize that there are toxic people in every business environment, and American corporations are corrupt. Trader Joe's is no exception, and they have made mistakes in the way they run things. However, I believe they are a huge step in the right direction in comparison with their competitors. I think they try to do the right thing and are therefore pushed by their community to continue improving more than other corporations that show no interest in improving. Again, I think it's important to recognize the good they do in the context of the capitalist culture we exist in. Of course, this doesn't mean we shouldn't demand improvement; I think it just needs to be aimed at this American culture more than Trader Joe's. Just my two cents."

-Caring Community
-Supportive Management
-Will work with you to meet needs in regards to transfers, scheduling, and any help you could ever ask of them.
-Sweet business model means eating great new interesting foods all the time for free and getting to turn others onto items that are so good are strange that they'll come back and hug you for the effort.","My store had 7 Mates (Supervisors basically) and 1 Captain (Store Manager). The mates alternated their schedules with our hour-block rotating schedules and no one mate is in charge of any one department. This leads to a lot of redundancy and a lot of ""who knows?"" As an employee I felt caught in a whirlwind at times, with one mate passing me and telling me to stock in the wine section, then once I start stocking my first box of wine a different mate will walk by and ask me to put the case I'm working on back in the back and just focus on fronting the section. This means I spent 10 minutes going to grab the case, bringing it to the floor, helping a customer, unboxing the wine, put one bottle on the shelf, then have to close the box, return to back, walk all the way back to the section, and then resume work. This happens multiple times an HOUR, 8 -10 hours DAILY, and you're looking at hundreds of times in a week sometimes. 

The good news: they seemed to be working on it and actively were seeking opinions, criticism on the structure, and looking for new ways to solve it. Of every job I've worked, they have been the most open to new ideas and improvements from each and every Crew member. 

So with all said and done, if you can be a good drone and pivot quickly, there are no cons. 
Even if that box of wine doesn't get stocked, you know at the end of the day that you are valued and did exactly what you were told. They never hesitate to let you know how important you are and that you're doing great work despite any confusion or wild holiday hours."

All my fellow crew members are uniquely interesting in their own right and overwhelmingly friendly, many are also quite accomplished and working at TJs as more or less a retirement gig. The pay is excellent as well, I was started at $16 an hour and they just raised our covid hazard pay to $4 an hour meaning I'm already making 20/hr plus full benefits working at a grocery store.

There's a reason Trader Joe's employees seem almost abnormally happy, it's because we are. This company treats us well and we do our best for it in return.",I sat here for ten minutes and couldn't think of a single thing.

Amazing employees transferred out by the dozens...mates were even super worried and nervous. When the new captain came, they changed everything in the store...from the layout (like thirty times), the signage (to bland and generic), the spirit ( everything that gave our backroom personality was thrown away), she got rid of the closer’s opportunity to purchase five items in five minutes at close, listening to one ear bud after close, literally every bit of happiness, enjoyment, and morale have been so crushed and removed, it’s sickening. It is literally day and night from what I happily loved two years ago. Everyone is bitter and it is such a shame one person can destroy something that was so wonderful and efficient, and a place where we all took such pride in our jobs and as a community. So sad."

1919,Trader Joe's,"Decent -good pay, health insurance, Toxic, profits-over respect and safety, anti-worker culture",2021-02-12,2.0,Crew Member,"-My coworkers are honestly great. Many of them. There are of course some awful people

-Pay is very good for retail, and as long as you do what is a very easy job, you get a raise twice a year

-Provided you qualify (30 hours average a week, working a minimum number months), you can get very good health insurance. Main reason I applied

-Casual attitude between workers (crew) and bosses (mates, captain)

-I do like many of my bosses interpersonally, despite them being awful managers and genuinely shady

-Sometimes, if you're lucky, mgmt will be flexible with your schedule","-Mgmt expects you to be an abuse sponge; when irate customers go off on you, you are blamed and suspected. This is especially bad during covid, when customers do not follow basic safety measures and take it personally when you ask them to cover their noses with masks, stand in designated safe areas, etc. I have been blamed for customers being extremely toxic in response to me asking them, politely, to follow safety guidelines, and after they go and yell at mgmt for ten minutes, mates/captain massage their widdle baby egos and actually reward them by giving them gift cards! No customer is seen as too unruly to be beyond treating like a special snowflake. In fact, the more toxic they get, the more mgmt will do everything they can to try and secure their continued business- and then tell you its your fault they kirked on you. Infuriating and degrading does not begin to describe how this makes me feel

-Company refuses to draw firm boundaries with customers violating safety measures. They even write it off with their creepy internal jargon, saying enforcing measures is ""anti-eloha"" (see: unfriendly). From the top down there is an unwillingness to confront problem customers and do everything possible to ensure everyone's safety during the pandemic. Children are allowed in without masks. Mates refuse to enforce proper mask wearing. Mgmt can punish you if you enforce safety guidelines in a way unreasonable customers find unfriendly (see: some people will inherently be offended by you asking them to do the bare minimum to protect both of you)

-Inconsistent communication from mgmt. You will hear a different think from each mate and your captain. Unclear if they are making it all up on the fly, incompetent at communicating, or both

-Mgmt are experts at paying lip service- they will tell you what you want to hear, but never take any meaningful action. They use this same gift for appeasement to deal with customers who are outrageously disrespectful to crew, and even them

-Very anti-union policies. I know of people at my store who have gotten fired for mentioning unions. Anti-union letters have been sent out. It is illegal to fire for organizing but this law is meaningless when unenforced, and trader joes is a billion dollar giant, crushing in the crib the chance of low income workers organizing actual power so they can truly advocate for themselves and have the leverage to truly control their workplace. Deeply, deeply immoral that tj's supports this, even if it is something most companies do in the anti-union reality of american politics

-Opaque, shady, and dishonest in communications about covid. Confirmed infections are sometimes hidden, manner of transmission is stated as being outside the store when it may well be in the store. Calculations are made to protect the company legally through omission or straight up not informing crew of infections, rather than be fully transparent"

They do temperature checks at the start of every shift and ask a series of questions to test your adherence to their Covid guidelines (matches State). Currently, they're offering an additional $2/hr. ""Thank You Bonus"" for working during Covid til the end of March.","The company is owned by a well known German family known for being on the ""wrong"" side of WWII. Could explain the covert racism, bigotry and misogyny that runs rampant within the ranks of management. 
Definite ""hookup"" culture exists. Hence, the reason why there are so many Covid outbreaks in our stores.

2057,Trader Joe's,Fake transparency,2021-02-04,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"Good benefits, great crew usually","The transparency of the company is a ruse. They claim to be ""the good guys"" but can say from experience that the people in charge are always looking for the easiest way to get out of trouble, not take a stance, and to make the most out of overworked individuals who are shackled by what we call ""golden handcuffs"" aka paying them just a litttttle bit more than other groceries stores, so they feel grateful and fearful of losing maybe an extra dollar per hour. This company might as well have invented the terms ""plausible deniability"" and ""scapegoat"". Their value are a joke meant to lull crew and customers into a sense of ""family"" that is completely fabricated."

Most stores have a very tight knit group of closers/morning people, and there is a lot of playing favorites for both. While the core values of Trader Joes are great and if you get your foot in the door it can be an easy fun job, I've heard and noticed not every store carries that same basic value.

Even coworkers in their early twenties have had back or knee issues after a year or so, and older employees sometimes end up having to leave. 
And despite the fun decor - this is a corporation, people get fired for trying to unionize at some locations, and I've heard of other locations having issues with racism and sexual harassment from management where workers have complained and management has faced no repercussions.

- ladder is climbable, but it takes time","- Overwhelming feeling like you are a Cog in a machine, as nice as they want to make that machine looks (part of the reality in working in entry-level work in grocery or retail.) Particularly when not many customers are in the store and you feel like are wasting half the day moving stuff on the shelves around that other grocery store chains already have innovated around.
- During the pandemic, they were reluctant to enforce rules regarding customers wearing masks simply because they were afraid of customer violence, but a lack of thought was given to enforcement measures that are common at other high traffic facilities (i.e. basic staffed security to handle unruly or mentally unstable customers). This is extra embarrassing considering the store is located next to a popular heroin dealing and dosing spot for Portland's Homeless. This unfortunately unnecessarily risked the lives of employees, many of which who were elderly and had compromised immune systems KNOWN to management. Glass was not even in the store until April or May.

2569,Trader Joe's,Good place to work,2020-07-24,4.0,Crew Member,Great benefits and friendly environment,Non flexible schedule and management varies
2570,Trader Joe's,"A solid, safe, dand friendly company to work for!",2020-07-09,5.0,Crew Member,"This is a quality company that does much to maintain its values of integrity to both customers and employees. The ""Mates"" (managers) and ""Captian"" (Head Managers) are consistently quality individuals who know how to do their job, communicate well with others and bring a wonderful attitude to the stores. 

I have worked at 4 different store locataions over an 8 year period. Except for the occasional ""people pleaser"" or ""power hungry"" managers -- which are very few and far between-- the whole of the crew desires to do a good job, make customers smile and create a welcoming community. 

The benefits that this company offers to even part-time employees, is incredible considering the current situation of our economy. Full dental, vision, and medical benefits, Paid time off, and regular performance reviews make this a solid and respectable company to work for.

A wonderfully flexible schedule! great for students and parents!","The job as a whole can be very tedious depending on the time of day that you work. This IS a grocery store so you will be doing, simple, remedial, and predictable tasks, day in and day out. The upside to these tasks is that you can generally do the type of work that you enjoy. You WONT get stuck in one area (say the ""meat department"") all day, every day. 

Just like any company, the reviews are... somewhat made up. You have to keep in mind that you dont just have one or two bosses to please, you have (depending on the store size) 8-10 bosses. Every single one of them has their own personalities, character and perspective. SO while you may do a realy good job in the opinion of one person, another may see only your flaws. Often, reviews all have the same comments as to ""how you can improve"". Basically to some degree, the bosses comments have to be made up and then put into an average score which becomes your review score. 

Either way, its pretty easy to get a ""full raise"". Just do a good job, be nice to customers and others. If you screw that up, the bosses will notice and they will tell you."

2574,Trader Joe's,Most Underrated Place to Work!,2020-06-23,5.0,Crew Member,Trader Joe's has a great foundation built around customer experience. Scheduling is super flexible and there are shifts that start as early as 5am and later shifts that end around 11pm. Right now we get a $0.75 raise every 6 months ($1.50/yr) which isn't bad for a grocery store. There's equal opportunity to grow within the company as well.,"There are usually 80+ employees for each store so not every crew member will have the best work ethic. It can be stressful when some are pulling the weight for others, but that happens in a lot of companies with this many employees."

2615,Trader Joe's,Incredible people and good pay,2020-05-27,5.0,Crew Member,Management is extremely understanding of personal issues and their kindness helps to promote hard work from their employees. The pay is better than comparable positions at most other grocery stores and the work environment is really enjoyable. There are also plenty of opportunities to get promoted.,The only real negative is the physically intense work lifting heavy items to prepare the store for opening and close. This should be expected at basically every grocery store job unless you are confined solely to the register. Trader Joe's rotates employees' responsibilities by the hour so that you do a little bit of everything. Managers are also often rotated between stores which can be a very sad experience for crew members because of the close relationship they develop with their employees.
2616,Trader Joe's,Flexible and fair employer,2020-05-26,5.0,Crew Member,"They are very flexible with regards to schedule. They are fair in assigning tasks, and don't assign anyone too much work.

I've been able to clock-in and work with my best friends for the last several years, no matter where I've transferred to. Hating your coworkers will not be a problem. Even if there are people you don't get along with, they feel like family. You'll be ushered into an accepting, caring, supportive work environment that carries over into your everyday life outside of the job and will always be grateful for it.","Because the company is still privately owned, each store is subject to be run slightly differently, and with relatively little pressure to conform to a national, or even regional standard. There's very little direct accountability for general managers, assistant managers, or regional managers who exhibit poor behavior. I have never seen genuine, long-term improvement come from upstream reviews. Store managers who've made life a living hell for their crew have gone on to open new stores virtually unscathed, hiring on entirely new crews who have no idea how poorly they're being treated compared to those working at other stores and have no experience with other store managers to compare with their current supervisor. You can transfer to a different store if you don't like your location's management style, but it can take upwards of weeks to months to secure a position in the area you're trying to work out of. Still a great company to work for, but when a bad apple slips through the cracks, it can take forever to get back to a joyful work experience."

This company is not for people with aspirations or the capacity to do more. It's a menial job unless you're a store manager.  Those advertised values are just an advertisement. 

While I threw my back working here, I asked a mate for help and it was made a huge deal that I asked for help. I'm not making this up! Your work will have zero value if you fail to be a part of the group/s or you tried to ask for any help.

Mates - assistant managers encourage creating groups and protecting their interests- I was told this by a female mate who is part of the group.

I was threatened termination because I Iodge a complaint against their friends. Instead of following up on it, I was targeted. Written up with misleading, false accusations multiple times. There is no transparency in the company. The atmosphere is awful and unhappy.

Retaliatory behaviors by Mates such as writing up with made-up stuff, having their group gang up, denial of service, harassment by constant following in the store and in the backroom, actively encouraging their group to go against one person - I've had other crew members warn me about this

Dump the entire workload which is physical work, on a few people while their own group hangs out, chats, ignores customers, ignores lines at the register, makes food, take food home and so on

Overall, mates - assistant managers are a horror show here. Unless you're a part of their group or don't resist their behavior, you would do ok."

Along with harassment from a crew member. Trader Joe’s has a anti-harassment policy but these people are so sneaky. The company’s core values are a joke compared to the things that the mates and long time crew members do. I honestly wouldn’t recommend anyone to work there. Often times I’ve heard that it was the location I’ve worked at which was 779. Many other crew members explained to me that other Trader Joe’s are not like that at all. Overall wouldddd neverrr recommend. I have so much to say but honestly just no.

It has created an environment where it seems Trader Joe's in general wants to increase their turn over and not keep older employees. I came from a much higher paying job with over 5 years experience in grocery and biology, then two years later new employees are being hired on with no experience for over two dollars more then I was started at. This company isn't as good as it seems, they pick favorites and never give good workers compliments. Certain workers get the option to do what they want while other workers are scheduled more time cleaning, and on registers, super visors aren't held responsible for the lack of respect they give their own workers. The complete and utter lack of training is appalling, new workers have no idea what they are doing, and it is the personal belief of the super vision and management that it falls to the crew members to do this not the people making more and setting the standards. Unless you are married or have children your schedule is the least prioritized and other people get better schedule times simply based on politics. The turn over at this store has become alarming, the new management seems to want to fire as many people as possible despite complete lack of respect. You can't work over 37.5 hours a week, and when its the summer your hours get reduced randomly, despite never calling in sick and constantly covering for other coworkers that always call in sick."

I worked for 647 Store in Old Town,  Alexandria!

I called out for my manager for braking the rules of the store as well I called out a crew member who lacked ethical values which were conflicting Trader Joe's values!

Captain got involved in supporting the manager of the store....

Working for trader joe's over all was a traumatic experience as well key people were quite fake which was terrible to be part of that store...

I am glad I am no longer part of that environment as they lack all types of skills!

2743,Trader Joe's,Rude Management,2020-02-11,1.0,Crew,Nice customers usually and good store discount,"They made me wait over an hour for a scheduled interview upon hiring, and that should have been a red flag at how little they value my time. And although I was overqualified (few years of customer service experience and an entire degree) they were just kind of rude to me the entire time. Acted like I owed them something because they hired me. I work. That's what I do to get paid. Not kiss up and be their yes-man, which is how they want you to act and will be rude to you if you're not.  They asked if I could cover an extra shift once and I said I think so, but I'll have to check with my husband and get back to you later and they said that's fine. When I called and said that I couldn't due to him having our shared car at that time, they were very frustrated and accusatorial. Just overall rude and poor management. Things that shouldn't have been a problem or were small problems were magnified and there were be lectures as if I was a child. Quit less than a month in and found a new job immediately."

2753,Trader Joe's,Still Just Retail,2020-01-15,3.0,Crew Member,"Among retail workers, Trader Joe's is better than most. They make an effort to provide health care, starting wages are typically higher than other retailers, and they feed you often.","There's still a pervasive attitude that the customer is always right so the workers get dumped on. As a part-time worker, you're only offered dental and vision versus regular health care. Though they say there's no bureaucracy and they want crew members to be themselves, they're now enforcing a strict dress code where you're not even allowed to wear the stickers they give out to kids, they're crazy about you clocking out exactly on time  (but of course you can clock in early) and, the captains and mates are given yearly bonuses that don't trickle down at all."

Management promotes a team-like environment","Pay is not high enough to survive in New York City, as wages have risen, newer employees are hired on a higher wage than employees who have been there for years.
Section leaders can often be very rude when you make a mistake and don't provide constructive criticism.

People - my coworkers have been some of my greatest and most understanding friends. They are in the same shoes as you are, so they get a lot of the things you go through in your life at TJ's.","Pay - new hires are paid more than employees that have been with the company for years. It's ridiculous. When minimum wage goes up, your current employees should get a bump - not just new hires.
Management - the mates and captains are hit-or-miss. A lot of times it seems like they weren't crew members for a long time, so they can't empathize with what their employees experience. Some of the managers are great! But I've seen good ones become controlling, or play favorites, or care WAY too much about their jobs. At the end of the day, it's a grocery store."

Super benefits. 
I learned a lot, I love how much they invest in product knowledge.
The customers are great. I know people gripe, but people love TJ’s so much and it can be really fun to talk about the products with them. 
You get to give away flowers to people and those small gestures can make their day. It’s awesome! 
GREAT products. I love this company for its products and values. 
You're encouraged to give your honest opinion to customers, even if you don't like a particular product. 
You get breaks and always are on the clock for a conversation with a manager or a tasting. 
The tastings rock. 
The general attitude is really good. I have some mixed feelings about my experience, but I still love this company overall.","Harder on women, boys’ club mentality among management. I remember the female manager often cut out of things. It was sad because she was cool. 
I was never given a warning then suddenly denied a raise at a review, was humiliated and disappointed with no opportunity to change the situation until it was already too late. Felt set up to fail without any chance to explain the miscommunications that led to their decision, most of which were very minor. 
Sometimes you feel like a human-robot built to stock and smile. 
Really weird about giving a sick day to see a doctor. I was sternly warned to get a note for doing it... once?! As an adult? Really? 
I was happier after I left. A lot happier. 
Hard on the back. Protect your back if you work here! 
Mentally difficult, you speak to customers all day and while it's often fun, it can also be draining. 
Best in a bad industry. 
The benefits are based on average hours so when that burnout strikes, and it will, you have to make tough choices. 
There’s a lot of people at the bottom so you find people spending many years without a promotion. I don’t recommend being one of them if you have any other talents."

2889,Trader Joe's,Corporate profits at the expense of employee safety.,2019-09-05,2.0,Crew,"Health insurance is good once you figure out how to navigate it (TJ's insurance provider will be changing in October 2019, so I can't speak to that coverage yet). 
Regularly scheduled raises. 
Consistent schedule if you've been at your store for a while.  
Store closed three days per year: Christmas Day, New Years Day, and Thanksgiving.","Safety is not enforced at the store level and not encouraged in any meaningful way by corporate. Crew works in unsafe conditions because it would be too expensive to repair them. The company consistently prioritizes keeping the store open for business over worker safety. Contests are held to see how long a store can go without any injury, which results in people not reporting their injuries. No action is taken to address safety concerns (unless you count vague speeches that we should act safely), so the same injuries keep happening. If people are injured on the job, employee must spend several days without pay, traveling to an understaffed and incompetent urgent care clinic to get cleared for work again. I have many coworkers who got injured while they did their best to work safely in a dangerous environment, and not one of them felt supported by the company (either in terms of physical safety or financial stability) at any point. An injury ends up serving as a warning to find a new job, before you sustain an injury that you can't recover from (like coworkers stuck on medical leave because TJ's isn't finding them treatment in a timely manner). Registers and shopping carts are designed in a way that maximizes employee strain and injury, but corporate doesn't think it's a problem because it encourages customers to spend more. Most employees have unreported injuries due to repetitive strain, and management's solution is a vague ""stretch throughout the day!""

Scheduled raises are not guaranteed. Corporate limits how much each store can pay in wages, which means employees are fighting against each other to see who will get a living wage. The company raise schedule can be changed at any time, as can the amount. I have seen the amount subtly decrease for everyone without notice (while still advertising the old amount to new hires). The frequency has decreased from what it used to be, but not in my time there. It feels like it's only a matter of time before they drop it to a yearly raise without increasing the amount.

Overtime used to be acceptable in reasonable circumstances, but now results in disciplinary action that can affect whether or not you get your raise - even if it's one minute over.

No holiday pay for holidays when the store is open. For the three holidays the store is closed, you lose your wages for that day. If you don't want to lose wages, you have to use your vacation/sick pay for a holiday that you might not even celebrate.

Vacation pay is sick pay, so people are forced to work ill if they want to take vacation. 

Discount is so negligible that customers think you're making a joke.

Food waste at a store level is massive. Maintaining the cold chain (keeping cold food cold, keeping frozen food frozen) is more of a wish than a habit.

Follows customer requests to a fault - if enough customers request a boycott of an ingredient, the store will validate unfounded claims by catering to them. If customers think an ingredient is dangerous, TJ's will pretend that it is, and will select less healthy, more expensive, more dangerous, more environmentally damaging options. Instead of educating, TJ's encourages and validates anti-science movements to collect short term profits at the expense of others."

It's fun to try/learn about new products and talk to all kinds of different customers.
This company promotes women, and doesn't tolerate sexual harassment in the store.
Raises every 6 months with good performance with usually open and constructive feedback about performance. 
After graduation I was surprised how hiring managers at other companies responded positively to seeing tj's on my resume, and it seemed to make them more interested in me as a candidate. if you're not planning to have a career with tj's and it's means to an end for you, it looks great on a resume because the company has such a good reputation, and people tend to have positive experiences shopping there.
Working here taught me SO much about how to give really good customer service, which has helped me in my career a lot.","Physically demanding work that inevitably leads to injuries/pains, and if you're not on TJ's insurance (working part time) there's not a lot of help for that.  not many benefits for PT workers.

2903,Trader Joe's,Company Coasting on Reputation and Previously Progressive Policies,2019-08-22,2.0,Crew Member,The atmosphere is upbeat and I enjoyed the majority of my coworkers. Customers are generally in a good mood and treat you with more respect than other service industry jobs. TJs does a good job breaking up your tasks so you are not stuck doing the same mundane thing for an entire shift.,"While my experiences might be more a  testament to my local TJs (Overland Park, KS), I was extremely disappointed in my time at TJs. The wages are no longer competitive and I was consistently denied opportunities for pay raises. When I was hired I was under the impression that I would receive regular wage increases, however management is under no obligation to hand out raises and will only do so if you are in ""the top 10%"" of employees. During the last round of reviews at my store several hardworking and consistent employees were denied raises.

Furthermore, management seems to be coasting on the reputation of the company as an exciting and progressive work atmosphere rather than actually working to uphold this reputation. They demand a whole lot from their employees and give very little (if anything in return). In the year and a half I worked there I was denied two different vacation requests even though I submitted them well in advanced (over a month and a half). And when I had a family emergency the mates I spoke with were unemphatic and denied me opportunity to leave. 

Bottom line, if you are the type of person who can make it at TJs (you have a strong and energetic work ethic, and can consistently come to work with a glowing attitude) you will find other companies that will value your work more. At TJs you are not going to feel like you are good enough and will have to really fight to get, what should be basic and readily available, wage increases."

2913,Trader Joe's,Great Job for Students,2019-08-21,4.0,Crew Member,"- First of all, the pay is nice relative to the responsibility. In my region, we are given bi-annual reviews with the potential for raises after each review. Not sure how that compares to other locations, but its nice to know that as long as a crew member continues to perform well and meet expectations they can expect a decent pay increase each year.

- Second, I really, really like my fellow crew members. Again, this varies from location to location, but my TJ's store is close to a college which means we have a young and lively crew. I've made many lasting friendships during my time at TJ's.

- Third, given that we hire a lot of college aged crew members, the captain and mates at my store are all very considerate and accommodating of school schedules. It makes the school/work balance a little easier.

I know much of this info only seems relevant to my store in particular, and it is in some senses, but what I'm trying to convey is that the culture at each TJ's is slightly different and is molded by the community. So if you like a young working environment, look for a TJ's near a college or university. If you like something a little more mature, look for a TJ's in an established suburban community perhaps. The size and the culture of each TJ's scales and adapts to the community it serves (hence the ""neighborhood"" part of the TJ's tagline). From my experience, TJ's is not a cookie-cutter grocer like some other larger national chains.","- Every mate's management style is different which means every working day is slightly different. Some mates micro-manage. Others expect you to figure things out for yourself. If you like consistent structure you may find this to be an annoyance. 

- Communication between mates and crew is sometimes lacking which is frustrating."
2914,Trader Joe's,Beware,2019-08-19,2.0,Grocer,"*Decent money, though at times felt like I should have earned more
*rad co-workers that become like family
*ten percent discount","* ever wonder what it would be like to be watched ALL the time, work at TJ'S they will gossip, spy, and look for you to fail
*management is sexist, and at times straight up cruel, have a lot going on personally? Take a xanax or anti-depressant, shut your mouth and put your head down because they Do NOT care. When you work there you are owned by them, and they will not tolerate you talking about anything outside of work related info. Want to say hello to a fellow worker? Tell them to get a drink with you after work
* they will THROW you around with your schedule, one week you might work 15 hours and the next 30, some weeks less then 10. So if you want to eat and pay rent, then you might consider selling your soul to trader joes, or just dealing with it and somehow find a second job, but good luck because you will never know what your schedule will be
*sexist* if you are an attractive woman, they will not respect you until you prove yourself. Prepared to be treated like a joke."

The daily toll of heavy lifting, constant moving, rude customers, and tough hours will wear you down extremely quickly. Furthermore, there is little to no room for advancement, unless you are taken under the wing of a mate, have a parent/partner/family member in a position of power, or have 5+ years within the TJ's crew.

There is freedom to be artistic and influential.,"The mate hours are horrendous.  We have no flexibility and the turnaround time is 9-11 hours.  A lot of mates commute 45 min or more.  The worst part is understaffing.  We are expected to somehow provide exceptional service yet we don't have enough crew members to stock the shelves and ring customers up much less provide carry outs and actually HELMS(what's that-doesn't happen).  Store trucks come at 8 pm and we are supposed to get the load worked before 11 pm.  Here is what happens, the mates feel pressured to get it done so they work so fast that they break their backs, literally.  All of this and I earn less than a lot of crew members.  It's not worth it and I'm looking for another job."

if you are a hard worker the supervisors will lean harder on you to make up for the lazy employees. if you get hurt on the job you'll be sent to a quack that will give you meds and rush you back before you are totally healed. i saw this happen to a unfortunate number of hard working employees. if your manager doesn't like you they can deny you raises while they give the lazy butt kissers raises, sundays off, and promotions. i had one awful manager (out of the 3) who was a control freak, always over your shoulder, would play favorites, and would not give me my deserved raises using arbitrary excuses like needing to see more ""wow!""

You might be at the register for an hour, and then your stocking shelves for an hour, and then you’re in the wine room for an hour. That keeps you from getting bored In one section. The pace is fast-moving. The benefits package is amazing, I think it’s the best benefits I’ve had at any job. The entire reason I came to work at Trader Joe’s was to provide insurance for my family and it’s been worth it.","The only cons I can think of, are during the downtimes in business such as January or August, getting the hours you want can be more challenging.

You're always doing different things throughout your shift, so you never feel bogged down by one task.
Your managers (Mates) are going to be some of the most level-headed, chill people you will ever encounter.
The routine review cycle is great; they get to review you, and you get to review the Mates. This keeps things transparent and awesome.
Routine raises every 6 months. EVERY. 6 months. Unless you really do something bad!
None of the customers are rude--they love to shop at Trader Joes and they love to have your help.
Your coworkers are gonna be mixed bag, but for the most part, you will always find 2-3 people that are just ""your"" kind of people.
Free food, crew tastings and crew events all of the time! BBQ's, days at the park, etc.
They empower you to pick up an order and take charge of a portion of the store if that's what you'd like to do.","Initially, it's not great to be stuck in the 3PM-11PM shift--it's late, and you're tired.
Alternatively, it's not great to be in the 4AM-12PM shift--it's too damn early, and you're tired.
I feel like there has to be a better system than the entire load showing up at 4PM and then piece-meal breaking it down on the floor.

3095,Trader Joe's,Great place to work!,2019-03-05,5.0,Crew Member,"Great coworkers, positive atmosphere, and great pay and benefits (full medical, dental, and vision available if you accumulate over a certain number of hours each 6 months, averaging out to be over 30 hours/week). We also get a 10% discount off of everything we buy, free samples/snacks on a regular basis, free meals/tastings several times a year, and a $50 gift card each year. The mates and captain all get together each 6 months to create a review for each employee (with the potential for a raise). Additionally, we have opportunities to rate the mates and captain, so they have an added incentive to treat us fairly/be nice to us, as well. We are provided with pretty flexible scheduling, since we use an app that allows us, to some extent, to select our own availability for scheduling each week. When I started working there, I was a little apprehensive about requesting days off fairly often (due to my kids' busy schedules and activities); but the person who schedules told me that it is no problem at all. He said that they want us ""to have a good work/life balance."" How many employers say that - AND really mean it? They are very flexible. On a few occasions, I have even told them on a Thursday, for example, that I had tickets for an event on that upcoming Saturday, and that I would have trouble making it in for my 6 pm shift. I said that I could be sure to safely be there by 8 pm. They said, ""No problem. We'll just change the schedule and put you down for 8 pm."" I mean, they have told me that I work hard and don't abuse the system. But I am saying that if you are fair with them, they are genuinely more than fair with us. Also, they move us around a lot - meaning that we don't often have to work in one position for very long at a time. They try to not have us on the register for more than an hour or two at a time. This is helpful to our bodies and to our minds to not be so repetitive with one task for prolonged periods. I also love the kind of liberal, hippie atmosphere!","The work on the night crew is really quite strenuous - more than a lot of people would imagine. And we work till 2 am (or a little later). This is actually a pro for me, but I realize that it would be a con for a lot of people. Also, our store is extremely busy. So while we have customers in the store, it is non-stop. Also, when the customers leave and we are re-stocking the store, it is also fairly busy and non-stop. We do listen to music and chat a bit, but we have to stay pretty focused and keep it moving!"

3099,Trader Joe's,Meh.  The same old thing from the same old retail play book.,2019-03-19,2.0,Crew,"I find it difficult to identify a single genuine ""pro"" to working at TJ's.  At best, you have a job and that's it.","--Complete lack of loyalty, even if the employee displays admirable loyalty to TJ's
--The degree to which one is required to destroy one's body to work this job is entirely out of step with the level of pay
--One must work like a dog for management to even consider granting you enough hours to qualify for health insurance; even then, it often is not granted.
--Not surprising for retail, dishonesty and favoritism is blatant and the order of the day among the management
--Again, not surprising for retail, the degree to which employees are expected to be debased on a daily basis by customers is completely out of step with the level of pay
--Essentially zero support from management with regard to abusive behavior toward employees on the part of customers; I've seen more than one person terminated as a result of fraudulent and spiteful calls to corporate.  Customers often simply lie just to get people fired--and it often works.
--Ridiculous expectations on the part of management; I've actually been present when people have been written up for not saying hello or not smiling when a member of management first arrives at work for the day.
--Promotions are mostly granted in accordance with favoritism or mysterious metrics that are never, and I mean never, explained.
--Health insurance is offered above a certain average number of hours, but this is often quite difficult to sustain, even for superb employees.  During every summertime lull in business, nearly everyone receiving health insurance through Trader Joe's is positively terrified of losing it.  Anyone who tells you otherwise is not truthful.
--Not by any stretch of the imagination a meritocracy.  Bizarrely, it is often the very worst employees, in terms of attendance, ethic, and willingness to work hard and learn new things, who are promoted."
3100,Trader Joe's,"Fun, Friendly Crew; But, compromising benefits and wage increases.",2019-03-18,3.0,Crew Member,"The company truly considers integrity and positivity when employing its staff, so you will generally enjoy who you work with. Free tastings and food samples are routinely given as a benefit for staff. There is an efficient order within each store, however, is it typical for each store to have a laid back vibe.","If you are late more than 15% of the time, you will NOT get a raise. I was told that I am one of the ""star""  top performing employees, but due to being late, I was not granted a raise, not even a smaller percentage of a raise. They are overly strict about this, which is not fair, nor does it reflect care and consideration for hard-working employees.  I was told by my store Captain that they literally can not give a raise to everyone, so they deliberately choose a fixed number of people who do not get a raise. Clearly, their more focused on numbers and not the individual. Additionally, I never received a warning or any helpful feedback prior to receiving my reviews."
3101,Trader Joe's,TJ’s is AMAZING,2019-03-02,5.0,Crew Member,"This company has it dialed in and I’ve never worked for anyone who comes close.  From the Captain to the Crew Members, I was welcomed warmly and felt comfortable from Day 1.  Our Captain and Mates are all able to work hard and have fun at the same time, and they are happy to jump in and do the same tasks as crew members.  What I’m trying to say is there is a true team feel, that we are all in it together.  No sense of someone looking down on you or over your shoulder.  You are expected to perform at a high level, which is easy to do because you are constantly shown gratitude and respect from the Captain, Mates and fellow Crew members.  It’s a feeling of family there.","The work is very physical and can take some getting used to.  The great thing is that we rotate from one task to another, typically each hour, which helps.  But be prepared for an adjustment period and some sore muscles!  Not as many hours as I’d hoped for during the slower season, but if you can be flexible, there are usually shifts you can pick up."

3116,Trader Joe's,Busiest store in town!,2019-03-04,4.0,Crew Member,"I work at one of the busiest TJ locations in the midwest.  I chose TJ as a second job because I love the interesting products, and that I get to tap into my hospitality background to make memorable experiences for our customers.  Our store is a well oiled machine, with a genuinely caring Captain, and a bunch of hard working mates.  Some of these previous reviews make me sad, because our management team is wonderful and appreciative of the staffs work ethic.  I like that the job is physically demanding and that the Mates (and Captain!) often work along side of you. Like, they would never ask you to do something that they personally wouldn’t do.  I obviously don’t see this job from a Mates perspective though... and I don’t think I would do well with 4 am shifts since I am not a morning person.  Still, I love working at Trader Joe’s and hope to work for the corporate office someday!","Hard to find shift coverage because there’s is no good way to access the daily schedule and people phone numbers.  Ok starting pay.  Some of the shirts fit weird.... like the T-shirt’s are pretty short, and the arms on some (not all!) long sleeve shirts are dumb and baggy.  Others fit perfectly."

I've always been incredibly proud to be a part of this company. If you're a foodie, you can't help but love the products, and it's always exciting to share that with the customers. It's what makes TJ's so fun! The company cares a great deal about taking care of their employees- we are well-compensated when it comes to pay, benefits and time off.","The hours can definitely be taxing as they vary from the start of the week to the end. Often times you feel spread thin, and many stores are chronically understaffed, which makes for a somewhat stressful work environment.  This is physically demanding job as well. Over time, your body will pay for the work you do each day. Though there are opportunities for advancement, they are very limited, and you must know that you will probably be committing yourself to a physically demanding job for your entire career."

- Crewmembers become friends for life","- Tendency towards relying heavily upon your producers with no reward or incentive, while simultaneously allowing other crew to slack ( hang out in the backroom, smoke,text, and treat the work aspect as optional)
- Store structure was reoriented in a way that creates redundancies in operation 
- Some stores operate under a blue team or red team philosophy with no numbered register assignments and no clear-cut idea of primary versus non-primary status, we need structure at the registers to ensure everyone pulls their weight and to reduce uncertainty in assignment which creates inefficiency .
- Your tenured crew   built the business to the current level, and many work tirelessly for their stores, yet after working hard and earning a raise twice annually for years  many of your best employees face a wage-cap with no hope of progressing further.
- Promotions of any sort are very difficult to obtain if you start as a Crewmember, in my store less than a third of leadership was promoted from within.
- Relevant to above Merchant position was an excellent vehicle to reward and retain the most dedicated Crew."

Cute children coming in with their parents and seeing their eyes light up when you give them stickers. If you are competent and reliable supervisors will quickly begin to offer you opportunities to take on more responsibility.,"Poor communication between supervisors. Frequent sexual harassment from male customers, poor response from store captain about concerns. Captain refuses to ban a customer who is known to sexually harass every woman who works there. 
The opportunity to take on more responsibility in the store does not come with a raise in pay. Not very motivating. Someone who is a section leader is paid the same as a slacker person. 
TJ's makes a big deal about how often it promotes from within, however when crew members are promoted to mates, they only get a $1 raise (at least in NYC). The only real pay increase they get is from the increased hours, but they are doing so much more work and taking on so much stress. Meanwhile, when they hire mates from outside of TJ's, they are able to negotiate their salary and are able to start at a much higher salary, a salary that you would have to work at TJ's for at least a decade to be able to earn through raises. Most mates seem perpetually exhausted and stressed to the max. This is not the way to hold onto quality people! It is demoralizing to know that your peer is making more money than you ever will for the same exact job, when they actually start the job with much less knowledge of our products, customers, and culture. If you don't compensate them more fairly, they will leave as soon as they can to get another job with their new management experience. I am not a mate, but this strikes me as wildly unfair and also an unwise management policy. I have known many mates who stepped down and went back to being a crew member because the insane stress was not worth the measly increase in pay."

3178,Trader Joe's,Carrot on a stick.,2019-02-08,1.0,Crew Member,It all looks good on paper.,"They cut your hours down to the bare minimum once you are on insurance and you'll be getting just under full time most weeks.  Once you have a few raises under  your belt, (they promise  two a year with good performance,) or are on benefits you will see your hours fall while they are still hiring new people at the lower rate if pay. If confront management about it they will deny everything. They will say you need to open up your availability to more nights and weekends but it's all lip service.  And really fir minimum wage you shouldn't have to be available 24/7 Youll start getting bad reviews and denied raises without warning. Everyone will act like you're doing great and then suddenly there are complaints on your formal review eggregious enough to warrant denial if raise with no warning. Bottom line:it's a terrible place to work and you'll barely be able to pay your bills. All of the old timers there will tell you it's lost its soul"

3190,Trader Joe's,Great company but an extremely physical job and mostly nights and weekend shifts,2019-01-12,4.0,Crew Member,"Great company, great management, great products, great co-workers. They bring quality and ethical practices to every aspect of the company! Also great benefits.","Unfortunately due to developing physical injuries I had to quit. Unknowingly I applied and got hired at one of the busiest stores in the U.S., a busy store in San Diego. And I started during their busy season and went from not working at all for several years to all of a sudden working 40 hours a week at a very physical job. So it did not last for me as I became injured right away. Pretty much every single minute of your 8-hour shift is on your feet, lots of heavy lifting, unloading the delivery trucks, stocking shelves of all heights (some very high where you need a step ladder, and some very low where you will be kneeling and bending down), ringing up customers (which is harder than it sounds), all of my friends would say what about just ringing up  items and being a cashier would that be better for you? Well imagine you are  1,000 times a day grabbing  a 3 lb  bottle of wine or a  gallon of milk,  or large bottle of olive oil,  or all the other heavy things that are in a grocery store. Over and over and over thousands of times a day and then once you pack up a bag you have to lift a possibly 20 lb. bag into their cart over and over and over all day long, so it's not as easy as it sounds, or collecting carts from the parking lot. Also, the shifts were all nights and weekends which is when all of my friends were free and all of the fun events happen, so my social life went from very fulfilling and satisfying before working at Trader Joe's to literally zero when I was working at Trader Joes. If you are newer you can expect to work ALL nights and weekends, as that is when most people shop and that's when they need their employees to be available. The lucky ones are the people that actually have day shifts and/or get to work just during the week, but you usually have to work several years at a location to get an ideal schedule. Unfortunatley I couldn't last that long due to my injuries."
3191,Trader Joe's,Well...,2019-01-10,2.0,Crew Member,"Usually a very accepting environment where they love you for who you are. Upbeat, everyone is there for you, and all the customers were somewhat pleasant.","Hours. They'll promise you full-time, but they only hire you part time. You'll think, cool, I'll still get fulltime... Until they decide you ""don't deserve it"".

The mates at my store seem to find any reason to act like you're not doing your job. Which will, in effect, cut your hours.

Management will lie to you and claim it's because of your availability, your performance, etc etc etc. Yet you'll see employees who've been hired less then 2 months getting full-time with the exact hours/availability you wanted to have BEFORE they even showed up.

Empty promises.

Told one thing, but another will happen. I was convinced by numerous mates and the captain that January is slow but February will pick up..... I'm still only scheduled 3 days a week.

They have this stupid bartering idea where if you don't have enough hours, well you just better wait for someone to offer up theirs because it ""will happen"". If it doesn't, well, you're out of luck."

Management has double standards including favoring employees, screwing crew members out of raises, gives out negative performance reviews without giving an explanation or examples to why they didn't give the person a raise,  and have seen them write up  crew members that they might not have particularly care over minor mistakes while letting more favorable staff get by doing the same action wrong.

I don’t believe anyone is ever written up for the way they talk to each other. There is such an extreme negativity amongst many crew members, especially in the morning hours.  Lastly, there is absolutely ZERO positive reinforcement. You could really go above and beyond with excellent customer service or do an outstanding job on the product team... we may collectively all get a “thanks for a great morning” line but the people that go above and beyond or just does an excellent job at what they are doing  never get acknowledged... Especially when there are so many lazy workers.  Unfortunately,  this can be a rough store to work in... lots of employee issues. Inappropriate conduct between managers and Crew members are very common. Some managers are good friends with employees and have shared inappropriate and personal  information with them regarding other employees.. 

Management  just took down all the beautiful artwork our incredibly talented artist made by hand that made this store desirable and unique - a true “neighborhood “ store! It just lacks a lot of personality now. Such a shame...

I’ve explained what I’m very good, but that doesn’t matter, I’m great at frozen, refrigerator section, cold pro, etc. but all I end up doing is the three things I don’t like, fresh, dry pro, and register all day. Working 8-1/2 hour shifts WILL burn you out. I’m failing some classes at school just because I’m working all from starting at 5 am or working midnight shift and doing very physical work, and you’ll feel sleep deprived. The other thing is that were always very low on employees, meaning theres always too much work and not enough people making the job very stressful. Last thing is that sometimes the wrong people get their own sections, making it much more difficult to work those sections because they over think everything. They add their own rules of how they want things done which takes up so much time. I think they do this partially to get that feeling their a manager. Last thing is that there is a very limited opportunity to become a mate and move up in the store unless your young or a minority."

- Health benefits kick in after 6 months of working there.
- 10% discount on groceries
- The work is quite easy and you don't have to take on additional responsibility unless you want to, or if you want to become a mate (manager).
- Mates are usually pretty hands off (there are exceptions), and will not micro-manage you.","- You will likely start off with irregular hours, and it will take 6 months to a year of working nights or early mornings before you can ask to get a more regular work schedule. Working until 1 or 2 is rough if you are not a night owl.
- The paycheck pays the bills, but there isn't much you can do to make extra money because  overtime is rarely allowed and they only schedule 35 hours.
- The physical nature of the work means that it's very likely that if you stay for a long time you'll get an injury. The job consist mostly of stocking shelves and ringing up customers, both of which put repetitive strain on your body."

High quality food, reasonable (and sometimes unbelievable) prices, friendly, caring employees with vast product knowledge, hand-drawn signs, cedar planks, WINE, and fun for the whole family.

It's also a fast paced work environment where learning is strongly encouraged (which is good, because there is an endless amount to learn) and there is true sense of camaraderie in the crew. ""Everyone does everything"" there, meaning you will absolutely spend some time on the cash register and stocking shelves- but, the company is generous in allowing you time to pursue your areas of interest as well. If you like flowers, you can quickly work your way into ""owning"" the section. The infectious upbeat attitude of the store makes the time pass quickly and conversations with customers fun. (most of us love talking about food, and are quick about opening products for our customers to sample...)

They have great benefits and competitive pay,","We are told that ""the Captain runs the ship"",  that Trader Joe's is an ""inverted pyramid"", that the ""crew is empowered to make decisions"" (for merchandising, decorating, celebrating.... etc), BUT (this is only MY opinion) our RVP is  kind of a nitpicky authoritarian, who was hired in from a megacorporation a couple years ago, and walks all over our Captain. The RVP likes to give VERY subjective feedback to the store and ""suggests"" changes that don't serve to improve sales, but do a great job at irritating the crew.

There is not a lot of good energy between the store's crew/managers and the RVP.
Everyone who transfers from another region says they just don't understand what's going on here. It doesn't feel like Trader Joe's.

Hours can sometimes get cut during the slow seasons-  if you have placed yourself in a position where you are really valuable to the store (leading the demo team, writing a major order), your hours will be the last to get cut- but it can and does still happen.

A crew member who has been with the company for 15 years is not guaranteed hours and can suddenly risk losing their benefits due to something that is completely out of their control. 

The crew has been suggested that we COMPLETELY open our availability (... from 5AM to 11PM, 7 days a week) in order to avoid losing hours. Choose one: Sleep schedule -or- health insurance.

Also, I can't draw, but I do know for a fact that the company DISGUSTINGLY underpays some extremely talented and hardworking sign painters. Not every store hires exceptional talent, but the ones that do start at minimum wage. There is no ""sign artist"" position, but exceptional goals, responsibilities, and demands are placed upon those who choose to paint signs, which only seem to become greater each year- as the company puts out more flyers, more instagram, ads, more online newsletters, then demands that the store represent and support these with signage, while simultaneously pushing to trim away as much sign-making time as possible. The result? The signage has moved away from being fun and creative to... plain and monotonous, employing mostly buzz words and marketing jargon handed down from the higher-ups. It's sucking the life out of one of the most eclectic, exciting things about visiting Trader Joe's."

3346,Trader Joe's,Good option if you're starting or ending your career,2018-08-06,4.0,Crew Member,"Very positive atmosphere, most of the time. Crew is upbeat, enjoys people, everyone works really hard. Some have aspirations for more responsibility, some are just happy to have the job and to make some friends at work. Managers have distinct  personalities, but everyone is subject to the Captain's personal style for the store.
* reviews 2x/year, 4% raise possible. Cap is $25/hr.
* can transfer to another store (even in another state) and your current wage travels with you.
* standard benefits, including free gym membership (as long as you average 30hrs/week)
* dental coverage is marginal; I've had better in other companies.
* Mentorship means 6 Crew (about) are assigned to each of the Mates, so you have a go-to person for questions. I didn't find this out until my 4th month, from another Crew member.
* Teen program allows 17  year olds to work, with limitations; great first job, seeing how other people respond to you, learning to be proactive.
* Older workers don't seem to lift the heaviest boxes, but oftentimes seem to connect with customers on more things, have shared life experiences?
* 10% discount on anything.","A bit of a boot camp at times, discouraged from talking with co-workers during downtime, mistakes pointed out more often than praise is given. Learn by doing, no real training, so sometimes the same activity is described three different ways and you can't guess the ""best practices.""
* It appears managers are regularly, and sometimes suddenly, assigned to other stores, which must explain why there's no coaching nor feedback.
* Dayforce, the online HR system, could use improvement. It's not easily learned, and the mobile app lacks some basic features, but it works."

There's an HMO- like gym membership program as part of their insurance plan. Incredibly physically engaging so you won't be sitting down for long stretches of time. Usually working with people who are passionate about food. If you ever want to find a genuinely nice person to befriend in the universe, you will find them working at Trader Joe's. Crews become very tight-knit and like family.","While physically engaging, it can also be incredibly taxing. Concrete floors are not forgiving.

3394,Trader Joe's,Pretty Good!,2018-06-17,4.0,Crew Member,"Let's be real, working retail can suck. However, Trader Joe's makes it actually fun and bearable. Keep in mind every store is different, but this was my experience working there for over a year:

Pros:
- The mates and my captain helped create a fun environment and truly cared about the crew
- It's a flexible job depending on your store needs and who does the scheduling
- The customer is not always right, and Trader Joe's understands this. They understand that employees are their number one customers and they treat them as such. I felt valued and like I had backup/support if there was a crazy customer complaint or something
- There was a huddle at each shift, where we could taste new products, try different pairings, and get updated on what's going on as far as the store and company news
- You get a 10% discount, which isn't that great, but it's better than nothing
- Medical insurance and dental insurance if you work so many hours
- 401K, semi-annual reviews (with raises), and annual bonuses
- Trader Joe's pays their employees a pretty fair wage. I worked in LA and they raised the minimum wage ahead of time to stay competitive and to retain good staff, which was really appreciated. I was considering quitting around that time simply because I couldn't afford the high cost of living, but after that I was able to stay.
- People stay here long-term. I had multiple co-workers (crew members at that) that had been with the company 10+ years. That says something about the company, especially with retail, which has a high turnover rate.
- They're good at hiring the right people. 
- The variety keeps the job interesting. I couldn't imagine being on register all day. I enjoyed being able to switch throughout the day.","- This is a hard job, physically and emotionally. You're on your feet all day, bending, twisting, and lifting. I was constantly sore, even though I'm young and workout, and lots of people had some nagging injuries. I couldn't imagine doing this for the long term. Plus, rude and difficult customers can get you down, but I would say the majority of customers are good people.
- Small carts (not sure if every store has them?) were awful. You had to bend down to unload the bottom rack and every crew member hated them.
- No employee wifi, which is... weird. Starbucks has free wifi. Why can't the break room? Not all of us have unlimited data... and I'm not even watching videos, just trying to read on my break.
- Customers take advantage of the return policy. I appreciate the policy, but it's too lenient in certain aspects. I watched customers buy flowers for an event and then return them the next day, or return them a month later after they're all dead. I also saw a lady break a bottle of wine and return it for full refund (wtf? how is that our fault?). 
- Mates get transferred. In some respects, I really like this, but it can also be hard since just as you're getting close to a mate, they get moved to another store. My store went through 5 mates in a year. But almost every mate is fantastic -- I only had an issue with one
- The annual survey for crew is great, but I wish it was semi-annual just like our reviews
- If you're on demo, god bless your heart. Some customers think it's their free dinner."

3398,Trader Joe's,Mate,2018-06-10,2.0,Mate,The great thing about TJs is you are able to learn slow you are held accountable for task that match your level of experience. The crew are generally easy to work with. The captains are not micro managers,Cons the work is very taxing I know 2 mates with permanent back problems and others with knee and various work related injuries. If you have a background in management throw it out the window you are not a manager here you basically are a crew member that has keys. The schedule is terrible I have not had a weekend day off since working here. I close mostly which is 2 pm to 12am. So hanging out with my family is tough. As a Mate you have to tip toe around performance issues with the crew you have no power period. They can run to the captain and make you look bad or worst case scenario get you fired also how the crew rates you directly ties in to your annual raise.

If you have to go to an appointment, you can switch with someone.","You'll get hurt, and you'll get hurt again. Then, you'll get hurt again. Be willing to accept major wear and tear on your body due to extreme expectations compared to other grocery stores and not fully recovering physically for a nonprofessional hourly wage. Also, don't count on getting the medical insurance. They can keep your hours just below the required level and then you're out of luck, no matter what they said when they hired you. The corporate office has a remarkable lack of ethics. I never thought they would be like that when I was simply a loyal customer. I've seen too many coworkers treated badly to explain away what goes on there. I'm fortunate to be built like an ox and to be young enough to recover quickly, but I've seen older people forced to do things when they said they could not safely do them, and they've been seriously hurt. Something is seriously messed up about that.  Basically, the stronger and faster get treated better than the hardworking and generally fit people who are not quite as strong or who are older and therefore have to be more careful. Sometimes it seems like management is trying to use up and then force out anyone who is not an athlete even if they work hard and are great with customers. Use 'em up, and throw 'em out. I've talked to older workers at other stores, and not all stores do that. Some give the older workers the less physically taxing work, but, for some reason, my store and some other stores just beat the living daylights out of them. If my mom worked here, I'd offer to support her rather than having her here because it would be only a matter of time before she was badly injured and TJ's would be claiming that it never happened and calling her a liar, mocking her, with management statements to back them up. It's disgusting. I'll be looking for another job soon. I just can't stand to see what they do to people. Yes, some enjoy it, but they are supposed to consider everyone's physical abilities and set limits on what they ask people to do. There is enough variety of work that they could do that. They also don't discipline employees who violate privacy and behavior standards. If an employee is a favorite of management, they can treat you like crap, ask you questions employers are not supposed to ask, gossip about you with false statements, etc. with no ramifications. As far as I know, everyone seems to like me. I smile a lot, work hard, and never complain. But, I'm more than fed up with this place. Enough is enough. As for career opportunities, a few will make it to management and make decent money, but they could make as much elsewhere without risking injuries and having to lie to keep injured workers from getting temporary income and medical help when they need it. It's not worth it for most."
3415,Trader Joe's,Great place to work,2018-05-16,5.0,Anonymous Employee,So far it's been a great experience working there.,Not really a bad thing but there's so much stuff to try and you're going to want to spend your check there.
3416,Trader Joe's,Crew Member,2018-05-14,3.0,Crew Member,"Good Pay. I started at $14.00 an hour. They have a system that you can trade off your shift  with anyone and be off or pick up another shift. You post your shift electronically online through whats called DayForce HCM. As long as you do not go 30 days without working, you can basically give away your shift as long as someone else commits to your shift. You can change your shift hours every week as long as management approves it. There's at least close to 150 to 200 people working in each Trader Joe's location (look in the cons section for the reason for all those employees working in each location).  The customers are really nice, and so are the employees. The culture at Trader Joe's is a good one, everyone majority of the times are in a good mood. You can taste test any foods in the store, as Trader Joe's wants the employees to be able to tell customers how the products in the store taste. The hours they operate are 4:00 am to 12:00 midnight, sometimes they have overnight hours if the delivery trucks come in late. They have a system called WOW customers, meaning if you feel a customers needs extra attention, you an give them a product for FREE! You just have to make it's scanned in the register and given to management.","Get ready to work VERY HARD! I mean HARD LABOR!!! BACK BREAKING labor. You will be required to lift and carry very heavy  boxes , stock shelves, pack groceries at the register. The physical labor is non-stop, sweat factoring. I am not kidding you, you will be physically tired after your shift. Avoid at all cost to work any hours beyond 4 hours each shift. The 8 hour shifts are brutal. Trader Joe's offers no safety back brace or belts for it's employees which I find to be wrong. Twice a day if not three times a day huge trucks come to delivery products which employees have to removed from what's called a pallet. Look  up what a pallet is and that'S what you will have to unload every time the truck comes in.  Management are usually at the bridge (basically customer service center) and some goof around a lot there (if you don't believe me go to a Trader Joe's and observe for yourself). You also have to clean the restrooms. If you have back problems DO NOT work at Trader Joe's. If you have a good back, expect to get a back injury which when you do they will tell you that the job description stated lifting.  The reason they have so many people working in each location is to spread out the physical work, but that doesn't work because the turn over rate is very high. Once people realize theirs back are messing up, then quit. Those who stick around, work very little hours a month."

My particular Trader Joe's has sub-par culture and terrible management but this is not representative of the company as a whole.

The pay is really good for a part-time job.","The only con for me was that while I worked at TJ i was in college full-time (16 credits a semester) and regardless of how many hours I wanted or put down on my application that I wanted to work I was almost inevitably always scheduled 5 shifts a week but left at 39 hours a week because they didn't want the crew members to be ""full-time"" so it was a lot to manage for me. Also lunch breaks are only 30 minutes long even with an 8 hour shift. Employee discount is only 10%."

3432,Trader Joe's,Charlottesville  store is phenominal,2018-04-26,5.0,Crew Member,"In my 25 years in retail management I have never been with a company or crew like the one in Charlottesville,VA. The manager and every one of his management team legitimately have fun while giving excellent customer service to customers, managing the store and all its deliveries, training to staff, and managing new hires like me. All this with a smile. This starts with the manager. He's been there for a few years and I cant say enough about him and what he has built as a team over there. He's phenomenal. The fact that he's been doing this a while and comes to work smiling, shaking hands and talking to the crew and customers after years of this, means that he knows his stuff thoroughly. It shows in morale. He knows how to manage and has built a team he is comfortable with, because they do what he does when he isn't there. You don't see that in retail very often, if ever.

The entire staff functions like a well oiled machine. They come running out of the woodwork like roaches when a bell rings, just to open a register or help a customer as fast as possible. They know their jobs and everyone does it well, willingly and with a great attitude. The moral there is unbelievable. All 90 of them get along great. I don't know when I have ever been around any company like that. They all treated me great as a new hire and taught me everything I needed to know. I can honestly call any one of them a friend.

I just left the Trader Joe's in Charlottesville, but it was only for personal reasons with changes to to my home life schedules with kids, etc. not for anything they did. I was there for a month and every day I was blown away by something about the company and /or the crew.",None I can think of.

3437,Trader Joe's,Slave Labor,2018-06-01,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Work for somewhat better than minimum wages,"You will probably get an injury while working. The company gives tons of lip service to awesome policies of rotating you every two hours so that you are never stuck on the same task for more than two hours at a time. This is ONLY lip service... You WILL be on the register for 6.5 to 7 hours straight and when you tell your manager you need a break and to be rotated you will be treated like a owned piece of Trader Joe's property and told NO. You will be promised great communication and no bureaucracy. You will experience horrible communication and excessive bureaucracy. You will be mistreated by management if you ask for them to back up their policies and don't expect to have their support when you end up injured. 
The manager I talked to when I was injured told me that there were no guarantee that they'd  accommodate me in any way. When i did go to the doctor, they sent me there without the proper form. When I drove back to get it I was begrudgingly given a blank unsigned form. I had to ask twice to have it filled out and signed. I was then handed a blank form with the managers signature and no other info filled out on the form. They DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOU! 
This place is such a nightmare. Injured employees at this location I work at in Oklahoma are very common. There are 8 people out on workers comp right now. Outrageous."

Some of my co-workers were particularly funny and interesting folks, because Joe's is a slightly off-mainstream brand and attracts that. Management was a mixed bag, but at their best some of the Mates were very good fun and down to earth.","Because pay is ok and benefits are good, there are a lot of workers here who think they've hit the jackpot in life by landing a grocery store job with health insurance. That can make for limited interations if you are someone who finds your life outside of the store more interesting. Some crew members were little too positive to be true which often made me feel like I was working at a grocery store in Stepford. The crew members who were the most interesting usually moved on to better things as soon as they could. 

As with any retail job, management favors the meek, the uncomplaining, and the workaholics. Negativity about the job is not tolerated, even though it is frequently justified. 

Store was often understaffed, even during recurring local events and holidays when data from previous years should have made it easy for management to not be caught out."

3493,Trader Joe's,Never work here,2018-04-09,1.0,,I guess the pros are that you get a paycheck every two weeks. Some bosses are cool and some shouldn’t have a job.,"FAVORITISM!!! If you haven’t been working here that long and someone else pretty much dedicated their career to be a long lasting Trader Joe’s employee then you’re SOL. Managers will speak down to you as if you are a nobody. They expect you to bow down whenever they “have a talk” with you. I hated the captain here. He was such a hypocrite and sexist. That’s probably why he got transferred within a 6 months period of being here. It’s so hard to get into this company. You need to know so many connections just to get a call for an interview. A 15 minute break doesn’t exist at the Encino Trader Joe’s. If you clock in too early for your break; you get a write up but it’s ok if you arrive late to work several times if you’re favorited by a certain manager. Trust, this place is a circus. On top of that, the customers are completely rude. This is ENCINO, all of the rich and famous come to this store. So not only are you being treated like you’re worthless but the CUSTOMERS demand you to wait on them hand and foot and if you don’t, guess who they go run and tell? The managers. So you don’t benefit in any situation here. This place will break you mentally. No matter how strong you may think you are. 
Not only that but they hire kids legit teenagers that are still in high school who can’t work that many hours, that can’t be cashiers, that’s can’t stock, etc because they are limited from school and/or their parents to do minimal work so that puts more hours with others who already work full time and have a family or go to school. Nobody has time to do anything because they play with your hours."

Management accommodates scheduling to particular and few (favored) employees. Overall it depends on who's running most of the show at the store; if you get along well with them it's okay, if not you're screwed. Unfortunately there's many real fools in management.

3535,Trader Joe's,Excellent...in the right location. Growing pains abound.,2018-01-12,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"TJ's has some of the best benefits without a union commitment for any retailer of its kind. It has a competitive base pay, a 401k that is second to none and, in my state, some of the best medical benefits at half the cost of your hard-earned pre-tax dollars as other places. The scheduling varies from store to store but, over the years, they have been very flexible and accommodating. The crew can vary as well but, it is usually a light-hearted atmosphere, and most stores are like a second family, taking care of one another in times of hardship. The best boss I ever had was at my first store. Not because he was trying to make friends but, because he was fair, and had a back bone. Although just one of the many bonuses to working at Trader Joe's, trying products, and having an opinion on them is pivotal, and each crew member is encouraged to open products (with approval) and taste them for themselves. There are frequent in-store, educational tastings, and even more frequently, free-for-alls in the breakroom. Trader Joe's used to hire only intelligent, qualified, common-sense laden individuals that promoted the store as a brand, and they have carried the stores for many years. I'm sure this is the case in more competitive areas. Many stores, with lower turnover rates, still have this core staff employed. I highly recommend this job for those completing college coursework, and plan on transitioning into the corporate world upon degree completion. The experience of dealing with a diverse clientele is really only second to the medical industry. People need medical care, and people have to eat!","As a TJ's ""long-timer"", I have watched this company grow from about 100 stores to over 400, and it is not immune to growing pains.  With a small home office on both the East and the West coast, the demand for corporate assistance and intervention, in stores, is beyond what the company is capable of handling. Many cases of misconduct go unresolved. Pay raises are fewer, and the internal feedback is limited to those times. Continued education and training do not exist at my current store. The size of your region will severely limit your options for upward mobility unless you are willing to move. Training for supervisory positions, unless adamantly monitored by you WITH your captain's support, do not move along at the speed at which they were intended to, and you can fall behind in training for years. Trader Joe's has gotten stale, and is now subscribing to the same corporate rigmarole as much of the Western workforce has."

Management is very bad, and they don't listen to the requests of their employees. It's a very caddy workplace, reminds me of highschool, everyone has an opinion about someone else or how they do things but won't address it directly to them, aka a lot of gossip. Oh, and you basically have to pretend you're happy all the time. The schedule is also very terrible. One day you'll work 9am-5pm to open the next day at 5am, which basically means 3 hours of free time before you have to go to sleep. So your entire sleep structure is destroyed.

A 10% discount on food
Every hour you are rotated on what you do, so it makes the work day go faster. 
Dental/Medical insurance, 401K, and even a gym membership","People often say the reason they want to apply is because it seems like a ""fun place to work."" Reading the reviews, you would think employees are in a cult and wear their TJ's shirts on their days off. But here is the reality: 
•	You are expected to lift. A lot. Heavy bags and boxes. And be on your feet for 8 hours. You are often sore at the end of the say because it is a workout physically and emotionally. 
•	You will have about 3 interviews for a position that pays slightly above minimum wage. 
•	While the few remaining veterans talk about how great the store used to be (25% discount, 4 raises/year, more of a 2nd family), no one talks about how great it is. 
•	What once may have been a team/family is now every person for themselves, with sycophants rewarded for their flirtation and flattery, while hard work goes unnoticed. A few people left in frustration for this very reason. 
•	Each store is different. One reviewer had managers that would accommodate your schedule for, say, finals. Our store was rigid when someone wanted to change from 12am to 11pm (""that's why we hired you"") while giving new hires the early shift that was requested.  
•	Tastings were once a regular thing so you could talk about the products, available for much of the day. Then they stopped doing them. They were brought back only because crew complained. Now we have them once a week (maybe) and can sample food - for about 5 minutes, eat-it-and-beat-it style.  Outside of that, we are expected to know a constantly changing stock by buying it ourselves from the low wages we make.  
•	The turnover is surprisingly high – as low as a few days, on average, about 3-6 months. I have even seen a number of mates leave in a very short time, and a couple that are already saying that they are looking for other work, because the scheduling leaves little work/life balance. 
•	Here is the kicker: At least 2 new hires have complained about the coldness of some of the staff. To this day, there are about 10% of the staff that have never even acknowledged me, made eye contact with me,  nor said hello to me once. I have no idea how they got a job here."

The managers are now eligible for smaller raises than the crew are.  They restructure every year or to and it keeps getting worse.  This last restructure involved the mid level managers losing their overtime.  We all have families and mortgages and this was a huge pay cut.  Losing our OT also affects out year end 401k contribution as it is based on hours worked.  and speaking of, the company slashed the 401k contribution a few years ago.

I had no prior experience in retail, but they started me off at $11.50 an hour, which is certainly not bad for a grocery store! Every six months, there's an opportunity for a pay raise if you get positive reviews from management and don't have any negative write-ups. In turn, the managers' own pay also depends on our reviews of them, so it's a very fair system that, for the most part, I think encourages everyone to treat one another with respect. Also, the mates (our managers) feed us a lot of delicious food for free, partly so that we can expand our knowledge about the store's products, but also just because they're thoughtful and nice!

This is certainly a job that keeps you on your feet, which I actually quite like! I don't enjoy all of the roles that we have to play in the store, but,  I love that the job generally keeps me active and moving around all day. However, if you tire easily or can't do heavy lifting, then there are also quite a few positions around the store that aren't quite as labor-intensive. 

Scheduling can sometimes be an issue too, but there isn't necessarily much that can be done on that front. I am almost always on closing shifts and often work weekends since that's the time when the store needs workers the most, but this schedule makes it incredibly difficult to find time to hang out with friends. I do think the mates are understanding about this, though. They try to vary the schedule a bit so that you get some reasonable free time. And, of course, they're generally flexible and try to accommodate your preferences whenever possible.","At the end of the day, it's a retail job, so you get a lot of retail problems, most of which stem from difficult customers as opposed to the company itself. The difficulty of the clientele can vary widely from store to store, so the degree and frequency of difficulty may be relatively high or low depending on the location. I suppose the store where I work falls somewhere in the middle, though there are certainly days when it feels like all of the worst people decide to come in at once. 

There are two main things about the company itself that actually really bother me. First, I don't like how secretive it can be about the sources of its products. I just wish there were a bit more transparency with respect to information about suppliers. And second, I absolutely hate how much excessive packaging there is for so many of the products and the lack of a more comprehensive vision of environmental stewardship and sustainability. It is absolutely absurd that the store I work for, which has been around for over a decade, only just recently got a large recycling bin. And even with it there, I still see my own coworkers routinely throwing recyclable plastic bottles and aluminum cans into the trash. Additionally, I don't think that the cups at the demo station used to serve food and beverages are recyclable, nor am I certain that they are sustainably sourced. If at the very least the cups were made of a plant-based plastic, I wouldn't be quite so annoyed with how much they contribute to the waste the store produces. At least the cardboard and most of the plastic wrapping from packages is recycled, but the ideal would be to not even have so much of it in the first place by simply reducing the unnecessary quantities used to package the products."

-hiring process is fast","-Schedule is bad, you'll be working most of the time early am (like 4am) or night (until midnight or later). If you have friends and family look elsewhere
-You have to move to a different store temporarily when promoted to manager
-It's retail and repetitive even if work is broken down
-Managers have to work 10 hours
-Customers are unusually needy at this store, they think Trader Joes is there to caress their ego
-No union, that explains a good amount of the above, for example mates working 10 hours. Labor movements fought for 8 so it looks like we are going backwards.
-No consistency with managers, you'd think your working in two different stores
-Micromanaging, usually done by the subpar managers or the people that don't do anything and think that's something
-One of the few places (or only) that makes you raise a paddle to call a customer to your register. On top of that you'll have some managers tell you to have your paddles up every 2-3 seconds (usually the ones who micro manage).
-Pay is terrible, what else can you expect from a private retail company owned by a capitalist
-I know at least 2 people who make more than me who came after me (and around same age and education level) but because of the wage increase they can in very close or more to what I make."

They cut every single employee's hours in the summer time when the students leave. They do this to employees who have worked for the company for ten plus years without caring if they can get by or not. The first captain I worked under was an absolute psycho path. Not exaggerating. It took the company over two years of receiving employee complaints to get rid of him. We had a rash of injuries this summer because our crew members were spread so thin and expected to get the work of two people done.

This job is solid for people looking to start a career, or just in between stages in their life. solid benefits, decent starting pay, and a chance for a raise that generally falls between .55 and .75 cents every 6 months.

3772,Trader Joe's,Pros and Cons to company structure,2017-07-05,4.0,Crew Member,"Everyone who works with Trader Joe's is original and brings an interesting background to the team. We have tastings and regularly open food to try for customers and ourselves. Unlike other grocery stores you won't be stuck on a register your entire shift (however if you're not a hard worker on the floor you may spend more time as a cashier than desired). There are two raises every year which are decent (often .65) and currently if you are exceptional you can receive a bonus every other review ($500 taxed comes out to $300). The insurance is why most people work at TJ's, you cannot beat it. We pay $45 (single independent) per paycheck for amazing benefits. Free gym, $20 copay, free therapy (Lord knows we need it). If you show initiative you could be a section leader and order product for the store and really make it your own. Scheduling is fairly flexible and the customers are typically very nice. The flat structure means that there is crew, mates, and a captain. Often you find that you have as much power as the mates which can be empowering to encourage your coworkers to do better or take initiative to start projects. They are encouraging if you want to be on the ""mate track"".","Many of the pros to TJ's are also their cons. The flat structure means that there is a lot of blurred lines as far as responsibilities. Often I feel that tasks and duties that are more suited for a mate can be put on the crew due to laziness or incompetence. Many mates are incompetent and the crew suffers as a result, most likely the hard workers who continue working while the lazy crew take it easy in the back. Because the company prides ""fairness"", you will receive the same bonus as everyone else (who gets their bonus). If you come to work on time with a smile you will receive the same bonus as the crew who order for sections, come in early for planned cleanings, and remerch your sections to increase sales. Additionally, being a section leader can be stressful when you do not get the support from your mates and crew that you need (again, you're not being paid extra to do this). It can be frustrating because you cannot change the fact that those crew that are capped out are making more than you and they do nothing. Communication is a huge issue, the mates do not communicate unless it's gossip.  If you want to move up, the captain may lead you on and say that your time is coming, but it's not. They just want you to continue to work hard and keep up morale. Going to the captain is hit or miss. It is the most effective way to express your concerns but you often will not know what came of it, if anything. Who stays and who goes it largely based on your popularity. If you and another crew did the same thing, but you are consistently cheerful and they can often be moody, they will be let go."

3780,Trader Joe's,No place is perfect but...,2017-07-12,4.0,Crew Member,"- The Pay: Starting pay is generally above minimum wage, especially in places like LA or NY. Every 6 mos there is an opportunity for a raise. Pay cap $25 and even then there is an annual cost of living raise. 
- Benefits: 401k, vision/dental for part time (+ medical for full time), paid vacation, ....
- Transfer Stores: NOT a guarantee but depending on availability, your performance its possible to move almost anywhere in the country and keep your pay/benefits, ect.  
- Growing Within the Company: Highly encouraged and easy to do. BA or higher means access to corporate jobs.
- Flexibility: Depending on your store management the job is very easy going regarding scheduling. Great for students.","It is what it is. The job as far as within the store is concerned does not change. It will always be the same products, the same customers, the same spills, ect. Nothing is perfect. Some managers are great. Some are not. Some stores are extremely high business others are the slowest in the company. 
If you have plan coming in its a great stepping stone to other things ie. finishing school, perusing other career options while still being able to pay the bills, ect. but unless you truly love working customer service (with all the difficulty that comes with it) this isn't a place to get comfortable at, which is easy to do.

For a retail job, the pay was very good. Employees get a 10% percent discount on their groceries. The work environment was fun and for the most part you get friendly customers. The nice thing is there is always something to do.",Sometimes your shifts can change. But other than that I have no complaints.

LOVED all my coworkers and fast paced work environment. It's a fun, egalitarian place to work where everyone's role seems pretty equal. Physical labor keeps you in shape! Being able to express yourself...liberal mindset. They are (for most stores) cool with tattoos, piercings, dyed hair etc. The benefits you get are better than most in the U.S. but that's still not saying much on a worldwide comparison for a company that makes so much and espouses mom and pop ethos",Usual customer service dealings (dirty diaper in a shopping cart anyone?? oh it's happened more than once!) and crappy hours (sometimes you're in at 4 in the morning and the next day you might work until 11pm...definitely hard on the body).

The best part was that many of the fellow Crew Members and Mates are friendly. I consider 75% of the Crew I worked with as an extended family! Lifelong friends can be made here! The interaction is great, whether with peers or the friendly customers. The pay here is good for retail, though you will be working very hard for that money, as this job is very physically intensive. The rotation of tasks throughout the day is great, and the Management is usually flexible with your schedule; helpful if you're in school. Other perks include the annual bonus, 401k plan, 10% discount, and nearly endless amount of food samples.","Keep in mind that this is retail, so it can get very hectic on weekends, holidays, and right before snowstorms! This also means that while there are many nice customers, there are a share of them who are either angry, very demanding, inattentive, rude, oblivious, etc. This location is a very popular store, and the parking lot gets crazy at times. Be careful crossing the parking lot-Don't expect cars to stop, and many will be speeding. Cart runs are fun on comfortable, sunny days, but you will also have them on cold, hot, rainy, and snowy days, too. While they are generally flexible with your schedule, be prepared to work nearly every weekend. Sometimes, turnover is as little as 10 hours, meaning you can work until Midnight, and then have to come in 10 AM the next morning, for example. 

That being said, the pros outweigh the cons. You definitely have to be a good person who works hard; though also be mentally strong to deal with the challenges of retail.

Not too much diversity at the mate (management) or captain (supervisor) level but it is slowly improving
Customers are always right while workers lack representation and backing. There have been instances where customers were out of line and rude to workers but when brought to the attention of managers the matter wasn't addressed and workers were not represented. There wasn't even a huddle on how we can prevent these situations from happening. The good thing is that these situations do not happen often (but a fair amount of times where it should be addressed). Some managers and supervisors will address situations like this and back workers but that's if you are lucky to have one or two managers that have dignity and empathy, and are just as concerned about workers as they are customers and Trader Joes as a whole."

3841,Trader Joe's,"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly",2017-04-07,4.0,Crew Member,"-Great way to earn a decent wage without a college degree. You don't even need a H.S. degree, I believe. 
-You can get a raise every six months. It's not guaranteed but it's pretty easy to get...Just do the work and be nice. Don't call out or show up late all the time.
-Dental and vision available if you work 3-days a week. Anthem Blue Cross/Blue Shield if you work 30hrs a week. You can accomplish this by working 5 days a week or 4 days and picking up someone's shift every now and then. You can also work at night and stay late to reach the total number of hours required during a measurement period (every 6 months).
-Since there are over 200ppl working there you have a good chance of working the schedule you want. Some people like to work early in the morning. Others like to work at night. Many have 2nd jobs, school and/or other obligations. 
-The managers are really positive for the most part. When you start they're patient and understanding. As long as you do your best, they're cool.
-Your co-workers end up being like a family. There are some really good people you will work with. 
-TJs contributes the equivalent of 10% of what you earn to a 401K. You don't have to match it. They do it on their own. It just takes about 6yrs for it to fully vest.","-It can be really, REALLY exhausting. You'll be lifting heavy boxes of apples and jars of sauces and gallons of milk. Even the older crew in their 50s and 60s hustle. We work even harder when the store is closed. In the morning we’re scrambling to get ½ the store packed out before we open and at night we’re scrambling to get the other ½ of the store packed out so we’re not there after 2-3am.
-If you want to earn more money, the only way to do it is to become a manager (mate). Crew members train new people and write orders for different sections of the store but receive no extra pay for it. Writing an order is a huge responsibility as it can mean not enough kale or too much that ends up going bad. It can directly affect the profitability of the store.
-Speaking of mates, if you become one, you'll be expected to work 10hr shifts, will be bounced to different stores sometimes on a day’s notice and if you close at night, you'll have to stay until everything is completed no matter what.
-Which brings me to another issue. If you close at night and have to leave at your designated time, the mates won't say anything but will be disappointed if you don't finish your section...Why? Because they'll have to do it.
-There's no human resources department. At the Brooklyn (Court St.) Store there are around 250 employees working there. The general manager (Captain) is your judge and jury. He can fire you at will. Fortunately he's pretty cool so you won't have to worry about walking on eggshells. Still, it would be nice to have an HR Dept. for sexual harassment, racism and inappropriate behavior issues that arise.
-For example, there's a person who has been writing the order for one of our most important sections for years. He calls his female co-workers, “baby” and “honey” instead of their names and has a macho attitude when talking to the guys. He’s a hard worker but many people don’t like to work in this section because of it including me. The captain, however, has an incentive to keep him in that capacity; it’s better for the store’s profitability. The worker has no incentive to change his behavior. He’s been in that same position for years and the captain is supposed to change the roles of the employees so no one person does the same thing and nothing else. I don't want to say anything because I have no faith that my concerns will remain anonymous."

Crew members do  a little of everything from artwork, stocking, writing orders, cashiering, and demo station. Great benefits!","Very, very physical job. I can't say it enough: it's an exhausting job. You will be breaking down pallets at an extremely quick pace lifting 50 pound bags of potatoes, four gallons of milk at a time, cases of jarred items, ect... You do it over and over and over again. You can never be quick enough, because there are always call outs and limited staff. They are always calling on you to do more with less people. Your hours are not guaranteed so during slow times of the year you might be only working 3-4 days a week. Mate positions are even more exhausting. They work 47.5 hours a week (10 hour days) on a waterfall schedule. They start the week closing the store staying until 11:00pm and then by the end of the week are opening the store starting at 4:00am. It's a rough life and very, very unfriendly for those who have a family. If you add a commute onto the 10 hour workday, you are gone all week without anytime for taking care of yourself or your family. And the earnings are not that great when you start out and your raise is only one time a year instead of two like the crew. The crew actually gets a bigger pay raise than the Mates. You can be making less than crew members, but have a ton more responsibilities. They really need to start this position hourly wage at the top of the crew range. TJ's has a very hard time filling these Mate positions, or keeping Mates due to the nature of the job and the pay structure. People burn out very quickly."

If you're looking for a relative easy position this might be the job for you. Honestly, it's perfect if you're in school. 

Be careful though, many of your coworker are lazy. Albeit, they are for the most part nice and funny if you buy into their thing. Generally though everyone is pretty laid back.

Of course much of the employee experience stems from the specific management team you are currently working with, but the company as a whole has gone way downhill as far as showing appreciation for their hard-working crew. Benefits and bonuses have decreased, and the current review process is unfair and subjective (it is now an all-or-nothing system vs. the sliding scale it used to be).

Communication between managers and feedback towards crewmembers is essentially nonexistent. Therefore, you quite likely will have no idea what might come up in your biannual review (oftentimes things that aren't even true). It also all depends on if the mate writing your review likes you or not. And of course there is no way to ""prove"" that any falsities in your performance reviews are untrue. Management's word against yours. It is so heartbreaking and discouraging to be told you are doing a terrible job, without having ANY indication you were doing anything wrong the entire time you had been working so hard. They have absolutely no hesitations in throwing you under the bus.

When you try to talk with managers, they pretend to listen, but never attempt to make any actual changes. Many of them are clearly only looking out for themselves. On the same note, they have an employee satisfaction survey, but nothing ever comes of it and it is never spoken about again. I always wondered if they even bother reading them. Absolutely no accountability at any level.

Training is a joke. You can and will be reprimanded for doing something wrong when you were never actually taught the correct way.

Hours get cut for veteran crewmembers while they continue to hire rounds and rounds of new people. So disrespectful for people who worked for years to earn the shifts that they rely on to survive. Turnover used to be very minimal, but just continues to increase - that should really tell you something.

They used to foster the individuality and quirkiness of their crewmembers, which was part of the whole fun Trader Joe's shopping experience. Customers loved it. But it is clearly not what they are going for anymore, as many of the ""old timers"" (crew AND management) have been forced out to make way for the new way of doing things. Hopefully they will be able to find hoards of painfully boring yes-men to fit the profile they are apparently looking for now. They're going to have a lot of spots to fill from all of the veteran crewmembers they've alienated and pushed out of the company. Have fun working for a bunch of spineless corporate shills.

Favoritism and sexism also run rampant in every store I've worked in. Typical Boys Club in most stores.

The company has changed tremendously in the last 4-5 years, and unfortunately not for the better. As they continue to expand, it is clear that Trader Joe's is becoming just like every other miserable national grocery store chain.

This used to be a company that I could see myself working at forever, but after almost 8 years I left the company with a very unpleasant taste in my mouth. Such a shame when all I ever did was sing the highest praises of my job and the company I had been with for a large portion of my life. I took a large paycut in order to rid my life of an emotionally abusive employer and grueling physical labor, and to be honest, I'm making the same now as I was at Trader Joe's because at least I get 40 hours a week at my new job.

Please read the other critical reviews. I promise they are not lying. There are so many others, many of whom were with the company as long as or longer than me, who have had the same experiences I have."

I went to help a crew member to pack the groceries and I was asked what team I was on and then told by the crew member that it would be better if I went out and got carts rather than help get the customer groceries packed.....that is really great customer experience.

If you aren't fun and personable, then don't apply cause you will not get hired, or the crew will eat you alive.","Physically demanding and exhausting. Most people I have worked with have had a lot of work related injuries which led to surgeries. Night shifts can be rough, but with a good crew, they can help the time fly by. Managers can be frustrating to work with, especially the ones who micro manage. A lot of them don't seem to care about the crew and they just want the work done. But they also have a lot of pressure to do well. If you become a manager ( a mate) then be prepared not to have a life outside of work. It's nearly impossible to get fired there, but if they don't like you, they will make work a living hell for you. To the point where you quit or do something to get fired. Also be prepared to deal with a huge variety of customers. Some of them are great, and I have made a few friends. But other shoppers can be cruel and mean, and really brings the moral down. Each store has it pros and cons, it really just depends where you live. Also, since the pay is really good, a lot of people are stuck there. Most people started working there in college, but realized that they make more money there then they would at a job in there degree field.

SPARE YOURSELF DON'T DO IT. Management is the most disorganized, dumb people I have ever met in my life. I am not exaggerating! Management is comical. It is a complete monopoly. I worked there 4, close to 5 years. I was in line to get my promotion (finally) after years of hard work and dedication. First to arrive, last to leave,  you get where I'm going. I was a model employee, yet management decides to renege on my promotion offer. Why you ask? Well management, my ""Captain"" as we call them is a man and decided that he would promote a girl with only 1 year experience over me. Strictly because he liked the way she look. I'm talking sexual harassment level. The ""Captain"" is a creep. I am a man of standards, he is not. Just goes to show you how messed up Trader Joe's is by giving this guy the highest level ""in store job."" Management lies to cover things up, throws you under the bus, and overall works you like a dog! Also its just not a good place to work. Hiring process is a nightmare. Seriously they act like there the FBI, get real it'a a GROCERY STORE. Why the need for so many interviews (5 in total). Just ridiculous, it happened to me and my colleagues. Just my experience with the Palmdale Trader Joe's. AGAIN love the store as a customer, but despise it as a employee. Oh well I put in my 2 weeks notice and jumped ship to a different job.

Sure, they pay more than most manual labor jobs ($13) but you are doing $20 an hour work for it.  Your shifts and days of the week are constantly changing and can range from 5am to 12 am (although they do ask for some parameters from you in the beginning) and definitely weekends.   
     You empty the shopping carts, bag up the items and lift all the bags back into the carts.  That alone is different than any other supermarket.  But, in addition, you also have to stock the shelves (which can entail lifting really heavy boxes) at a pretty fast pace and go out in all types of weather to gather shopping carts.  It is A LOT.  You do all of this every day as you are constantly moving every hour or two to a different area .   
     There are about 5 ‘mates’ with the Hawaiian shirts on any one shift with about 20-30 ‘crew’.  So, the ratio is about 1/5:  almost like day care (apt analogy).   So, as you move from place to place, a mate is there to check you in and basically watch you.  And, they have a lot to say to pick at your performance.  So, if you like a job with absolutely no independence and love being micro-managed, this is the place for you.
     And, did I mention medical?  Their website alludes to the fact you can get medical while only working 28 hrs/ wk.  I was clear to mention at my interview that I would like to qualify.  Thinking back, I should have known that that was a pipe dream as no one even acknowledged that that was a possibility.  It would be easy to attain during the holidays (before you are eligible) when I was scheduled for 38 hrs/wk. However, after the holiday rush, I am sure that is why I was let go while they retained most of the other seasonals, none of whom wanted medical coverage.  Why pay out for medical when they can keep a high school kid?   
     So, don’t believe all their California, kaisen, touchy-feely nonsense.  That only has to do with how you treat the customers, not how they treat employees.   They are a corporation, just like FedEX, and watch their bottom line just as ruthlessly.   Am I bitter, you bet.  I quit another job hoping to get medical, worked like a dog and their reason for not retaining me was ‘we are going in a different direction’.  Even when I asked for clarification, they repeated that phrase, which doesn’t even seem to apply in this situation.   So even though glassdoor says it is a great place to work, I didn’t drink the kool-aid and am offering a more realistic perspective."

3957,Trader Joe's,Crew Member,2017-01-23,5.0,,The workplace culture is phenomenal. Very team and goal oriented.,You tend to work either closing or opening shifts. Not much flexibility in schedule.

3960,Trader Joe's,Awesome place to work for!,2017-01-22,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Great place to work for!,Not much Cons about Trader Joe's
3961,Trader Joe's,CREW MEMBER,2017-02-01,4.0,Crew Member,"Crew members are considered part-time, that being said I work 37.5 hours a week on average and have a regular schedule with two days off in a row during the week. I work Sat. & Sun.the health insurance is extremely affordable if you maintain 30 hours + per week on average. 

We get good correspondence from the CEO and a gift card  ( up to $50) once or twice a year to thank us for good results.

If you are lucky enough to have a good store manager the ship sails well, the mates are in line and behaving well. If you do not have a good store manager it can become toxic and take a long time to be resolved, but YOU HAVE A VOICE it WILL BE RESOLVED. HR listens, regional managers listen. 

Trader Joe's is authentic about their customer experience promise. 

If you are older there is no where to ""grow"" financially. You get a 60 cent pay increase every six months. I have been with Trader Joe's 4.5 years and make less than $15. per hour still. But if I do my job it will increase by $1.20 each year. Capped at $24. I think. It will take me 8 years to get there. 

If you have lots of restaurant or grocery experience and are young enough and flexible with commuting or moving and up for the daily physical challenge and large crew members numbers to manage  (65-140) you can be a mate and make much better pay, and one day a Captain (store manager). If you are over 50 when you join Trader Joe's - 
those options don't exist in reality, at least at my store.","It is a highly repetitive job which almost always= injuries (muscle strain or worse) which means missed work and using up the precious little Absence Reserve time allotted. It would be great if the A/R were greater or there were additional sick days with pay. 

There are to many chiefs - These are the mates (assistant managers) making most of the payroll. They work 50 hours a week (10 is overtime). Crew members at my store get no weekend differential or holiday pay."

General low-stress work environment -- you go, you work, you smile, you chat with customers, you go home. Hard to be bored or lonely there. Management worked to accommodate everyone's scheduling needs as much as possible. They provided plenty of skills-learning opportunities, such as section leadership and demonstration giving. Some of the mates were amazing and made you want to work your butt off for them. The customer base is lovely and getting to know regulars and watch their kids grow up is pretty sweet.","They do not pay extra for section leadership (although being a section leader may incentivize them to give you a general raise.) Some of the mates were not great (micro-managing, passive-aggression, short-tempered.) They expect a high level of engagement/prioritization from all their employees, despite the fact that they know that many of their employees are working 3 jobs, parents, students, etc. They had different standards for different employees (re: if a top employee was having an off day, they'd get a lot more flack than a poorer employee usually gets.) Their starting wages were fairly arbitrary and uneven, it just depended on who happened to hire you, which is frustrating. They would often start you at a pretty low salary."

The biggest con of Trader Joe's is their denial to deal with real issues. If a serious issue comes up it is constantly downplayed. This includes forms of harassment, I experienced a sexual harassment seminar that was a complete joke and seemed to make both male and female employees more uncomfortable (Crew does have high respect for one another and most times harassment isn't an issue).

4160,Trader Joe's,Adopting the corporate greed model,2016-09-06,1.0,,A small employee discount. Customers often enjoy shopping in the store.,"I've worked for this company for many years as a crew member. Unfortunately,  nepotism has always been an element for the employees to be aware of. I was lucky to be on the good side of management for many years but that changed with a new store manager and a management team that followed suit. Many employees in my store have experienced unfair and biased reviews, especially the older employees. Lot's of decent employees fired or ""encouraged"" to leave the company so as to move in newer, younger cheaper employees. I've also watched decent employees go for years without a raise because they did good jobs but were not in the ""favored"" circle with management. It used to be the employees were genuinely happy at the stores, but now the smiles and small talk are there due to fear. Checkout counters have been minimized to increase intimacy with customers but to cut down on ergonomics and safety for both employees and customers. It used to be employees strengths were considered when placing them in different departments of the store, but this has fallen by the wayside in the name of cross training. So if you want to feel special this is not the place unless you become managements little star by sacrificing your sanity to do everything imaginable in the store. A new atmosphere of competition has also been set up so expect to fight like a pigeon for what little hours are tossed down from management. The scheduling system is on the dayforce app and employees can now forget about any personal considerations when it comes to their schedule and hours. Your sick pay will be bundled with your vacation pay as ""absence reserve"" so if you get sick...forget about that vacation you had planned. Employees are encouraged to even donate their absence reserve to employees who experience hardships. Really? I would think this company could dig a little deeper themselves to help employees in need. An insult to pawn it off their ""peasants"". This company uses the term ""Kaizen"" to to represent their values. Sorry to say this has proven to me to not be the case."

4196,Trader Joe's,They've treated me well for many years,2016-07-07,4.0,Part-time Crew Member,Starting salary has been great. Even when I applied 15 years ago. Those starting recently are very happy with what they were given,Benefits are hard to come by unless you work an average of 30 hrs. The company has changed over the years and isn't such a small town feel good store anymore.
4197,Trader Joe's,Fading fast,2016-07-10,3.0,Team Member,"Friendly team members, open management style, varied tasks, fantastic customer base. Trader Joe's is still one of the best places to work retail...however, that is changing.","Health Insurance. Sorry, TJ's, but you messed that one up big time. We all once qualified for healthcare at 20 hours average per week. That changed about 2 1/2 years ago when the requirement was moved to 30 hours per week. For those of us who work in slower markets or who have summer slow downs, it has meant that we can no longer depend on your company for our livelihood. Employees that want to work 30 hours can't due to slower business and as a result are pushed out of the insurance and into the marketplace which for my family will cost twice as much as it does through the company for comparable insurance.

Scheduling has changed drastically over the last 2 years. It is no longer based on a mixture of availability and merit. It is now based 100% on availability. If you have a child, if you have responsibilities, if you are married, you can't be available 100% of the time. It's impossible. So, if that's your deal, you won't get hours. Only people with 100% availability get enough hours to live or qualify for insurance. Over a two year period, my hours scheduled have been cut in half, despite glowing reviews and raises. My availability was actually lower the previous year when I was getting more hours. I opened it up even more and got half the hours. I have no indication from management that my work is nothing other than exemplary. I'm only told that my availability is ""limited."" I've worked in retail before and my availability while not wide open is not ""limited."""

The descending schedule (start with closing shifts the beginning of the week and end with opening shifts at the end of your week) is hard.  During your work week you only have time to eat, sleep and work.  It's a physically demanding job, not bad for a few years but will take a toll on your body over time."

Only have health insurance with full-time employment, and in order to have full-time employment guaranteed, must usually open up your schedule to be available 24/7. Long-tenured crew at most stores (most crew members have worked for the company for 8 to 10 years or more) means that there is fierce competition to rise into mgmt.; you will have to wait 5 years or more to have a chance to be promoted to mgr.

Whether you've had a bad or good customer interaction, weren't hustling enough etc. it's very insidious---and the discriminatory attitude the Palmdale store employs in upper management is bound to be sue worthy.

AMAZING customers, and I mean amazing. Truly keeps you coming back to work and that all is apart of the culture of why the specialty grocer -- Trader Joe's is unique.

Our personal connections we build not only within our store and community but also the extent that our CEO goes to let us know how appreciated we are for helping to remain rated at the top. Each store counts and matters, each employee is valued is how these simple personalized messages to the crew. This is huge and matters because if makes it feel like a family.","Management can be frustrating and hard to communicate with despite it all teamwork is important and hiring the right team is something my store did well. Although, when trying to merge these personalities together advise against gossip and keep harmony often management does not make the effort to truly resolve the underlying issues together. So the uncomfortable or lack of respect between co-workers can remain and continue to fester. 

Lack of ability to really move forward and keep Trader Joe's as a long term career choice. Salary cap when I started was $3 above my pay rate I started with which was, in my humble opinion, especially looking back at all the hard work I dedicated myself to...was honestly too low of a starting point.

HR is a nightmare. Most of the time, you do not feel like they are working to help you understand even the simple benefits and support you in other ways. Often feel as if you got nowhere and not worth calling them in the first place--and that is not the purpose of HR."

Pros include great training, great safety, mentors, positive working environment, sufficient supplies. Every hour or half hour you are doing something different. At Trader Joe's I exercise my body and my mind and am supported by the full-time staff. Since I was hired in October I am technically part-time but work 40 hours and have great health benefits including free gym membership, counseling, and small co-pays for doctor visits. The full-timers get reviews by the crew and switch stores frequently ensuring you never, ever have anything but an unsupportive manager. Hours are plentiful and flexible. Many of the crew have been working at Trader Joe's for over 20 years. We have seven values that we go by and we measure ourselves by how we live up to those values. Almost anything a customers asks, we can say ""yes"" and take time to help them. I feel supported both by management and by the company (the company provides lots of communication, access, and info to Crew on a weekly basis). It is truly an honor to work here.",I would say the only cons are if you move up to management. You have a rotating schedule and you have to switch stores frequently.

Overall the pay was decent given that I had no experience working in a market prior to getting hired. There were regular raises (so long as you had a good review which isn't hard). In the end I would recommend it to anyone over any other market. I've heard some horror stories about other places, and I just get weird vibes from the environment at a Von's or Stater Brothers.","Biggest disappointment was the ability to move up in the company. I spent 8 years at the company and voiced my interest in going into management. They seemed excited to give me information on it at first, but there was no follow-through. If they didn't think I was up for it that's fine, but it would have been nice to be told that rather than encouraged then have it never be brought up again. The management structure also changed not long before I left which made it difficult on some of the long-time managers/full-timers.

Very great job that gives you raise every 6 months. Better than any other part time job or full time job because its flexible. Of course you should have open availability to begin with but it can change once you hit your 6 months.

4313,Trader Joe's,"Trader Joe's has been great for two years, but could be so much better!",2016-03-08,4.0,Section Leader,"-Diversity among crew members. Very gay friendly. Employees from all different backgrounds and age groups. Lots of fun and talented people. 
-Customer base. Although sometimes needy, most customers are very knowledgeable about TJs products and share an enthusiasm with the crew when new products come out. TJs customers go out of their way to shop here a lot of the time, which creates a more positive environment than say having customers who just see grocery shopping as a chore. 
-10% discount on all products is more than fair. It's kind of fun asking for a three bell when visiting a store out of the area or state. Usually stirs up a fun conversation. 
-You get out what you put in. Many employers run their business strictly on seniority or on who you know. Sure there is favoritism here like anywhere else. But if you're willing to give complete open availability, push yourself to accept new challenges like being a section leader even though it doesn't come with a raise and is much more responsibility, and you're patient and willing to do whatever is needed, opportunities to advance will arise. 
-Starting pay and availability of hours weekly is significantly better than what is the norm in the retail and service industry today. While most jobs will want to start you around $9 an hour, and you'd be lucky to average 20-25 hours a week, the opportunity at TJs far exceeds that.","-Very little, if any training for new hires. I came in with over a decade of experience in the grocery business, but for those who it is their first job or are new to the business, I could see things being very overwhelming. 
-Safety training and culture, including food safety. Stores and back rooms are VERY cramped, sometimes to a dangerous level. I understand maximizing square footage to profit levels, but when stores that were built to handle $100k in sales a WEEK, and are now pushing $700k a week, something has to give. Lots of heavy lifting and little or no training on proper techniques. Back room coolers are often stuffed to the brim, and most of the crew finds it acceptable to just push a table of perishable product out into a room temperature warehouse for longer than is safe or recommended. Even when breaking down deliveries, stacks of fresh, highly perishable salads and dips can often sit untouched on racks on the sales floor for several hours. 
-Management styles. Starting off new at Trader Joe's often feels more like joining a fraternity rather than a job. Full timers will often heckle and have inappropriate comments. I wouldn't go so far as to call it harassment, because it's not, but not always the most professional. Some times this can lighten up the mood, other times it leaves one puzzled as to where they really stand. 
-Supply chain. TOS. TOS. TOS. Discontinued. Product ordering caps. Most customers and employees are used to this song and dance, but it's tough disappointing customers on the daily due to product supply issues. 
-There's a clear divide between externally hired management, and those that are promoted from within. Eventually it's all a wash, and I do not envy those hired as mates from outside the company. You are walking into an emotionally charged, intense situation. Crew members are passionate for the most part about what they do, and it is not easy being the stranger walking in the door. I do envy though the starting pay of most externally hired mates."

4332,Trader Joe's,Full-Time not a sustainable career...,2016-02-21,2.0,Mate,"The food... The great, simple recipe ideas. Samples. Seriously, you are eating something delicious every day. 

Because we hire a broad range of diverse, engaging people, there are no better people to work with. People generally work hard, are friendly, and uplift and support one another. 

The benefits are pretty wonderful considering it's a grocery store.","I am a Mate, or Full-Timer. There is absolutely no way around it: Trader Joe's will take up every waking moment of your life. You work 50 hours a week and are expected to run every aspect of the store, from breaking down pallets, copious amounts of admin, HR... All while smiling and showing no signs of frustration and giving every customer a perfect experience. 

You will have no life. When you finally get a day off... Which will most likely be in the middle of the week... You'll want to sleep all day. Your second day off you will do your chores, errands, etc, and if you're lucky, maybe a friend will be up for dinner or something. Nothing too crazy though, because for everyone else, it's a week night. You'll go back to work the next day feeling like a social loser, still tired, and ready to repeat the process. 

You will get injured. It's only a matter of when. Every single person I know who works at Trader Joe's for any length of time will have back problems, repetitive motion injuries, especially us Mates who are typically responsible for breaking down the load every day. 

Your friends will NOT understand your schedule, and slowly you'll be written off as a social option because you are ALWAYS working... Or at least always working when they're off. 

If you are coming in from the outside and starting out as a Mate, you might receive a decent wage. If you're like me and you're promoted from within, your wage will be a laughable slap in the face for the amount of work you do and the amount of BS you put up with every day. With a smile on your face, of course. 

You'll be caught up in it all at first. You'll drink the Kool-aid. But slowly, over time, you'll see exactly why I've become bitter about Trader Joe's and cringe when I hear people say things like ""Oh I hear it's such a great place to work! Everyone is so nice!!! Yay rainbows and unicorns and butterflies!!"" Blerggggg."

I promise that I am not just saying it when I say that I actually look forward to going to work. I smile and laugh at work more than I do at home on some days. The customers are expecting this great environment upon entering the store, so it is a self-fulfilling prophecy. The customers are in great, talkative moods and that makes our job so awesome that we can't help but smile, which then reinforces the customers mood. I am so happy that I applied to Trader Joe's. It is my first job and I feel spoiled.","I believe in providing cons when talking about anything, so I wracked my brain for one about working at Trader Joe's.

Chaotic scheduling means you can't have much life outside work hours. Customers don't realize that behind the smiles is pain."
4354,Trader Joe's,Best Job I've Ever Had,2016-02-05,5.0,Crew Member,"Trader Joe's is a company that actually cares about its crew members. I know, I know, we've all heard that before about other companies, but Trader Joe's is different. A Trader Joe's crew member will never feel like just another drone working under uncaring management; instead, they will be treated like human beings with opinions and ideas. Trader Joe's is all about the idea that success starts from the ground, which means making sure that the crew members are happy.

Schedules, which are required to be posted two weeks in advance, can be flexible; if you have a situation that makes you absolutely unable to work at certain times or on certain days, Trader Joe's will work with you. On top of that, Trader Joe's uses a program called Dayforce, which you can access on a store kiosk, your home computer, or through the app on your smartphone. It makes certain tasks, including looking at your schedule, approving your timecard, requesting days off or shift changes/swaps, changing your availability, and much more, easy!

Trader Joe's offers great health insurance benefits to its crew members depending on the number of hours you work during a certain period of time. To get full coverage for medical, dental, and vision, you must work 780 hours during the allotted period, but smaller plans are offered if a crew member cannot work all of those 780 hours.

Trader Joe's is also not a minimum-wage job; when I started in 2013, the average starting salary was $10/hour, and has only gone up since then. Additionally, Trader Joe's holds biannual reviews of all its crew members with an opportunity to receive a raise of up to 60 cents per review, so overall you have the possibility of receiving $1.20 raise per year, giving crew members a great incentive to stay on with the company long-term.

On top of all that, I just like going to work every day. I know that when I get there, I'm going to be treated like a human being. I know I can joke around with the mates (key-holding managers) and the captain (store manager). I know I'm going to make someone's day. I know that when I go to work, I'm wanted there and appreciated there. It's hard to put the feeling into words without cliches... We're a family, of sorts. We care about each other and want to see each other succeed.

Trader Joe's has given me the opportunity to make some really great friends and have some great experiences. I love working for Trader Joe's; it's a company I'm proud of being a part of and one that I can really get behind.","If you want to move up in the world of Trader Joe's (e.g., promotion from crew member to mate aka manager), you have to transfer to a different location for training (though you absolutely could transfer back if that store had an open slot for a mate). This proves to be highly inconvenient for mate-hopefuls when the nearest store to transfer to is an hour or more away. The two closest stores to my current store are both an hour and a half away from where I live. The pay raise, honestly, isn't worth it when I'd have to drive an hour and a half to get there, work the typical ten hour shift that mates work, and then drive an hour and a half to go home. I'd be spending thirteen hours a day on this job, and that's assuming I only worked ten hours. I don't feel I'd be able to give TJ's my all if I'm constantly exhausted."

They encourage store tastings so you know what to tell customers about specific products. I work full time and get great insurance(Blue Cross). If you've worked a certain amount of hours you can qualify for 401K. Once you opt to get insurance they send you a ""fit card"" which is basically a card you can use to go to any area gyms that acknowledge it, in other words a free gym membership. L.A. Fitness were I live accepts it so I basically have free access to their gyms. Occasionally Depending on how well TJ's is doing that year the company rewards ALL of its employees. Last year(2015) all of us got $25 TJ's gift cards at the end of the year, and they also did it in 2014. Also employees get 10% discounts on anything in the store. The Company heavily promotes from within(check cons as well on this topic). Depending on the ""Captain""(store manager) they may arrange company outings and parties. My store's captain took everyone who opt'd to go, to Dave and Busters. Everyone does everything, and everyone does the same task which is great for your resume(see cons). Meaning you WILL be a cashier, you WILL stock, you WILL bag, you WILL get carts from outside, you WILL clean, you WILL consistently lift heavy and light boxes, you WILL use pallet jacks(if you know how, its not hard), you WILL greet customers, etc. etc. All of this will happen at different times and may or may not happen everyday, but expect it because it WILL happen. The company may alter tasks for certain individuals with special needs. If you have been in a car accident and have a bad back they wont have you lifting heavy things. My store had a person who was hard of hearing so they altered their routine and put up signs for customers to let them know this person was deaf, as well as buying a sign language book so all of us can learn and communicate to them. All in all its a great company to work for, not too many companies give raises every 6 months, and not too many companies respect their employees. I love it so give it a try! Or at least give the food a try!
~Tj's Crab State","Depending on store location hours can vary even if you are a section leader. I helped open a store in Houston, TX. and in a month I was a section leader. Texas is supposed to be the second largest market for Trader Joe's, with California of course being number one. When I Started I was working 37.5 hours a week but since it was new a new market area, our store was a little slow so they cut all hours to employees except mates to between 27-32 hours a week, some under-performing people were even cut to one day a week. I now work in Maryland and as a section leader, guaranteed 37.5 Hours. So it depends on were your store is located and how much business they generate. Trader Joe's gets two trucks a day, one in the morning and one at night. So you may have to be at work as early as 4 A.M. and the latest 12 midnight, although depending on the load you may leave at 12:30 A.M. ""Mates""(supervisors) work 10 hours or more a day, and have descending schedules. So if they work 4am-2pm on Monday, Then Tuesday they may work 6am-4pm, and Wednesday 8am-6pm and so forth and may restart the next week. So there really is no set steady schedule for them. The company encourages promotions from within. While it's not impossible to get hired as a ""Mate"" if you have the exp. of course, but it is a-lot harder and more challenging because, TJ's is cautious of hiring someone from another company. Lets say for example someone from Walmart who may want to come in and run and implement things like they did in walmart, they strive to be different. Everyone does everything, so if you like to be a cashier but don't like to stock this isnt the job for you, if you dont like lifting boxes this isnt the job for you. ABSOLUTELY NO OVERTIME! For anyone but mates and higher ups. Boxes and cardboard drying up my skin, boooooo :-(."

- Good benefits, though I hear they have gotten not-as-good since I left. The insurance was excellent, offered to all employees, and only cost something like $50/month (has since increased substantially). The retirement plan was unheard-of, and unmatched by any other employer I've encountered: 15.4% of your earnings were deposited in a mutual fund every year, with no contributions on your part. NONE. That's a 15.4% bonus squirrelled away for you annually. 

- Depending on what area of the store you have, the work can be really easy. Possibly mindless, if that's your thing.

- Management was fairly liberal with the free stuff. Maybe it was some free beer, maybe a few pizzas showed up at lunchtime. Also, there was a Christmas party most years, which was nice.

-............the more I think about it, the nicer that 15.4% was. It merits another mention.","- Store 'leadership' was an absolute farce. There wasn't a single person at any point that I looked to as an example of how I should conduct myself. Most of the ""full-timers"" (as supervisory staff is called) had apparently never held a job where they had to lead people. It showed. They were just people who wore different shirts, had access to the safe, and got paid way more. Speaking of...

- While it's cool that TJ's pays well, when the next person up from you is getting paid more than twice what you are, the inequality is too much. It's impossible for management and staff to relate to each other when one lives in the richest suburb in town, and the other can barely afford meals.

- Is 10% the best you can do for a discount? From a multi-billion dollar company? When a good number of employees qualify for SNAP?

- Expect to be moved between departments often, and without asking you if it's ok. One day you'l be getting carts and stocking wine, the next you'll be working frozen and ringing up groceries. 

- Lots of standing, lots of lifting, lots of walking. Plus you'll work in the freezer and probably the parking lots finding carts. Bring a coat everyday.

- The schedule is all over. One week it'll be mornings, the next you'll be there til midnight. Change your availability to not work a day? They'll cut your hours."
4405,Trader Joe's,Horrible,2016-01-17,2.0,Crew Member,"Most crew members are friendly 
Health insurance if you work 30+ hours a week
Some managers are honest and hard-working","Used to enjoy working here but not anymore. It used to be that managers or ""mates"" would actually be a valuable part of the team and actually help the crew accomplish the daily and nightly tasks. Now there are too many of them, as if everyone needs a babysitter, and half of them stand around doing literally nothing when they could be doing their job. Instead they will stare at crew members making sure they work fast enough or walk around like prison guards barking orders. They seem to think they get paid to ""manage"" and ""watch"" but actually they are supposed to be essential for the functioning of the store! The mates at my store are so entitled and have no idea that some mates around the country in other stores actually do work. People think they make yearly salaries but they are actually just hourly employees who are scheduled more than 40 hours a week, so they make overtime pay every week. It must be some legal loophole so they aren't salaried. 

Human resources is basically blasphemy, so if anything happens that would normally involve input or mediation from human resources a crew member is left to fend for themselves. If a crew member chooses to speak up about a serious problem, say involving harassment or mistreatment, they will be ignored and left to feel helpless. You either have to go to management, who may be against you considering the prevalence of favoritism, or quit. 

The people who actually like working for this company are brainwashed. They have no idea how little the company cares for them. The company is expanding everyday yet benefits, raises, and whatever left of the original company culture is diminishing. Everyday I'm spoken to like a child when I've been with the company a very long time, longer than some of the managers. This may seem like it can happen in any retail environment but trust me, there is something very very different and sinister about the way this company handles itself. It won't even prove that all of its products are non-GMO, yet still makes the claim! And the crew members and customers just believe this lie blindly!  Think twice before you get sucked into the supposed perfection of Trader Joes."

The number one value is Integrity and they need to change that because they have none. They make changes to raises and benefits and let the employees find out about it as opposed to telling them. The benefits went down from when I started and even after I left. I wouldn't rely on them. One of my previous bosses actually said we were not to pass on applicants with disabilities. So many horrible HR issues went on but with HR only in California, it was always one sided and in favor of the store manager. I was smart enough to not speak up because I saw everyones careers ending around me that did. Thankful I was able to get out and wish I had done it sooner. As a manager the hours were gruelling and work-life balance does not exist! Job advancement is limited with only mate or captain positions. There isn't a goal to work torwards.

The environment is very fast paced.  Even as management, you are always moving and always working.  There is no sitting down.  I sit down for my half hour lunch break and that is it.    There is always something going on, you will never be bored.","By far the worst part of working at Trader Joe's is the schedule.  It's not how many hours you work, it's how they are bunched together.  Many, but not all, Trader Joe's stores use what they call a descending schedule.  You start your work week by working 2pm to 12am.  The next day you start  a little earlier, like 12pm to 10pm, and each day after you start a little earlier and earlier.  On the last day of your week you work 5am to 3pm.  So in 5 days you go from starting at 2:00 in the afternoon to starting at 5:00 in the morning.

I like how even store managers and the store captain do the same tasks as everyone else throughout the day. From my experience the store functions as a team and this is great place to work if you like a fast paced environment.,The biggest downsides so far have been difficult customers and working on extremely busy days or holidays.

You can feel the half-heartedness in the Captains and Mates as they implement new rules from Coprorate which usually compromise efficiency upon implementation. Captains are becoming reluctant to hire new staff and are forbidden from allowing overtime, so the employees are being bullied to pick up the pace which leads to more injuries.

No matter how hard you work, or have corrected issues there is not a word of appreciation for hard work and loyal service. Management uses punishment tactics rather than a motivational skills. 

One can be blacklisted by management and past on to future managers so there is never any clean slate. Managers appear to no nothing about management skills when it comes to motivation and helping crew succeed with expectations; it's all about trying to use whatever they can to degrade crew in reviews. 

People with good management skills don't last in Trader Joe's. Managers with no educational background move up the ranks who don't even like people!!! I can't stress that one enough. 

Too much favoritism. To little engaging and caring is shown for crew. I've worked with mates who have not initiated a hello or seldom do for years of working with them. I've worked for Trader Joe's for a VERY long time and see LOTS of poor morale and it's mostly caused by management and their lack of management and people skills.

Not to mention, the pay is not bad at all for a young, part-time worker.","I have been with the company for 3 years now. Once you form a friendship with your coworkers and learn to love the idea of working at a truly unique grocery store, you start to see through the facade. The intentions of the company are great, but it really starts to feel shady after a while. Pay rates vary for the ""lifers"" and for full-time management in an unfair manner. I work, and have worked with some great people who do very little work (or none at all) for nearly twice what I make now, just because they have been there longer. The company also has a policy that, if you decide to transfer out of state, they wont match your pay to wherever it is you go. For example, if you move from a suburb of Virginia to New York City, you'll have three years worth of raises and decent pay in Virginia, but you'll get to New York and realize the employees who started yesterday make more than you, and the company will not adjust your pay, despite the time you have spent with the company."

it used to be that only an average of 17 hours per week were needed in order to qualify for health insurance.  Once ObamaCare went into effect, Trader Joe's decided employees could get just as good coverage for the same price or less through the ACA, so increased the number of hours needed to 30 in order to qualify.  This was a very poor move on many fronts in my opinion.  

Your experience working at Trader Joe's will vary drastically based on the location and weekly sales of your store as well as what the captain is like and the people he hires.","If you are not able to have ""open availability"" you may not get all the hours you need.  Open availability means you do not have any restrictions as to what hours you can work -- which is as early as 4a.m. all the way to 11 or 12 at night!

4544,Trader Joe's,Trader Joe's Culture is changing and not in a good way,2015-10-15,1.0,,Good food and most of my co-workers were really cool. I used to work for Safeway and it was lightyears better than that.,The cons definitely outweigh the pros. This is a physically-demanding job so if you don't like standing on your feet for a long period of time or lifting up heavy objects then the job isn't for you. I started about three years back as a deckhand (bagger and cart wrangler) and then worked my way up to a cashier and overall a more involved role in the store. I could definitely see the culture change and probably the biggest change myself and other workers saw was the company cutting back on benefits. And this was a real head scratcher because the company is making more money than they ever had so I'm guessing they are reducing benefits to cut back on spending therefore increasing profit. I also was thrown under the bus a lot of the time and slanderous rumors were thrown around often at me for no apparent reason. Even though most people were cool deep down a lot of them do not like their job because they don't get paid a lot and their bodies hurt and they are struggling to make ends meet with their dismal salary. That is why it is best to get a college degree and shoot for the stars instead of sticking with complacency and repetitious retail jobs like Trader Joe's. It is best to always be careful who you are around because there are about 90 other workers and saying one thing could spread like wildfire. Also do not ever let your performance review tell you that you aren't a good worker it is just a piece of paper and management has to think of at least one flaw in your work. Since I am in college it was a good part-time job but I strongly do not recommend it as a full-time job. Get a degree and look for a higher calling.

Originally great, but it's time to move on.",2015-08-18,3.0,Section Leader/Crew Member,"You work with a great group of people, everyone tries to enjoy themselves while at work, there are a lot of ""tastings"" of our products for ""product knowledge,"" you get a 10% discount on your total purchase at every location, and they try to be flexible with scheduling. I've meet two of my best friends after working at Trader Joe's.","I applied and was hired at TJ's in 2009. I originally loved my job, the store, and my managers.  However, in 2011 Trader Joe's underwent a major restructuring and changed their business model and direction entirely.  Merit based raises were replaced by set raises, that are awarded on a pass/fail evaluation. (So one weakness, area for improvement, or in some cases a difference of opinion with management, is all it takes to ""not meet expectations"" and not get a raise.) Opportunities for advancement were plentiful before the restructuring; now, they barely exist.  Our time off requests were limited to 2-3 months out, ensuring that there was more dialogue concerning time off. The current system requires at least a months notice, but if you wait that long you'll never get the time off, which evolved into everyone requesting time off months (sometimes 4-5) in advance to ensure approval. The pay is lacking for section leaders or anyone with additional work and responsibility. Under the merit based system, team leaders were compensated for writing orders, section maintenance, cleaning, displays, training, installing standards, and being model employees. Now, you get nothing for being a section leader. Regarding the shifts, I'm almost certain most crew members have shift work disorder because of the lack of consistency in scheduling. This is especially true for Mates ( asst. managers.) If you're lucky, have put in your dues, or happen to be buddy-buddy with the schedule maker (one of the mates,) you'll get the hours and shifts you want.  There is widespread favoritism, by Captains (GMs) and especially the Mates. (Don't ever make the schedule writer angry.). But the main con to working for Trader Joe's now is that the original culture and atmosphere that made it such an amazing place to work is gone.  Dan Bane is a profit driven, bottom line kind of CEO.  He has changed the direction of company immensely and in the process has destroyed the great culture of the company.  In my opinion, and in my store, morale is at an all time low. Many employees are leaving the company, ( 8 in the past 4 months, 7 having 5 + yrs of experience.) As a crew we evaluate our Mates and Captain once a year, for two years in a row we have given our management team the worst reviews in store history. Our Captain's review was the worst in his 20+ yrs at TJ's. Mostly all having to do with new changes to the company and their failures introducing said changes to the crew. All in all, for new employees that didn't know or experience TJ's in its heyday it should be fine, you'll work hard and have a little fun. For those that know better, it's been a sad disintegration of what was once an amazing company and job opportunity."

Most stores are great about granting time off, and understanding when you have emergencies and personal issues happening. Great pay, depending on your previous work experience and education.

I've worked every weekend (unless requested off) for the last 10 years. If you have a family you will have very little involvement with it and if you are wanting a family you will never have an opportunity to create one. 10 hour days are not that bad but it's the times of the day you work. 2pm-12am or 3am-1pm all in the same week. So not much of a life outside of the store. The worst part of this job is the job itself, which is also sometimes referred to as a ""career"" here but we all know being a grocery store employee is not a career."
4605,Trader Joe's,"A good place to work, if you are willing to work very, very hard",2015-07-27,4.0,Crew Member,"Competitive wages for retail. If you consistently perform well, you can make a good wage at the company. If you are with the company for many  years, you can do quite well. Many crew members have been with the company for 10+ years, which is a good sign.

Most stores are open a very wide range of hours, many start as early as 4:30 AM and are open as late as 12 AM. Competitive raises and performance reviews for eligible crew members are currently offered on a twice-yearly basis. Great for students and people looking to work nights and weekends!

Assistant Managers (""mates"") make good to excellent wages for working retail, with 10 hours of mandatory overtime a week.  Most managers, especially at well-established stores, are knowledgable, friendly, and have been with the company for many years.  

Coworkers are friendly and fun to work with. Management is approachable and most ""Captains"" have been with the company for 5+ years, many started out as ""Crew"".

If you are scheduled enough hours to obtain health benefits, they are quite generous and affordable for the quality of care offered. Dental and vision are offered with fewer hours required. 

Paid time off accumulates based on the hours you work and you can use it (mostly) at your discretion. There are no blackout dates, and it can be used for illness or vacation.

Transferring: It is possible to transfer to other Trader Joe's locations. It is not unheard of to have a crew member transfer to another store within a large city, or even to transfer across the country. There are requirements and limitations, of course, but it is a cool perk if you are looking for a change of scenery and want to stay with the company. I have many coworkers who have transferred to or from my store.","High turnover in some stores. However, in some stores, crew members have been with the company for 10-20 years.

Management is constantly changing the ""rules"" for how to work, usually resulting in doing the same job twice or in having safety-improving tools being off-limits during open hours. Often back-breaking labor with minimal tools for safe lifting. Age is no barrier to the physically demanding work...whether you are 17 or 60, you are expected to break down pallets and carry heavy boxes. 

Everyone works a variety of shifts, often with as little as 8 hours between shifts (ie: 3P-11P one day and 6A-2P the following day). Assistant Managers have set schedules, but few crew members are given the luxury of a set, predictable schedule. Childcare and family life are hard to manage with the schedule, unless you have a partner with a supremely flexible job. Difficult to budget during ""slow"" months, as weekly hours may vary from 16 to 35 hours per week.

Some managers are fantastic, while others are lackluster. There is a high occurrence of transfers amongst management at the various stores in an area. This means that assistant management of the store is often changing like musical chairs. Usually assistant managers don't have a say as to where they are transferred or how often, which can be difficult for them and for the crew. Favoritism is a problem at most stores. Some crew members can get away with anything, while others are constantly being watched. If you are a manager's ""favorite"" you usually have it pretty easy. If you are not outgoing or have trouble getting along with everyone, this may not be the right job for you.

Some stores understaff to make sales and budget numbers look better. This results in an already overworked staff getting exhausted, especially during night shifts."

If you ever need to appeal a decision or accusation, you will see 0 documentation against you. When I started with the company management was very active in helping with all aspects of the store side by side with the part-time crew members. The company went as so far as to let you sign into your shift by hand on your time card, the trust level was unheard of. Times are a changing at the ""NEW"" Trader Joe's you are not trusted, you are not a value, you are not cherished for your customer service knowledge or care. The crew itself is now being hired for their looks and not their drive or knowledge of grocery or food in general... think Abercrombie and Fitch of grocery stores. It is trendy to work for TJs now, so the company is into heavy turnover and promoting unsuccessful young inexperienced crew members into mate positions (lower in store management). They have also been head hunting ""talented"" managers from other companies that are not from the same retail category  e.g. home depot, lane bryant. The managers are not a part of the culture that has been Trader Joe's, they are cut throat ladder climbers willing to step on anyone,kiss derriere  to superiors, coddle lazy work ethic, enjoy high school social behaviors and do things even if they know them to be wrong. I witnessed many flagrant abuses that were rewarded again and again. Sexual misconduct, drugs, absent from store regularly, captains on injury then leaving the store without leadership, and I go on. The review process is inconsistent and is used to cut out employees (expensive). Management is rotated so often they are like tourists, they come in act like they own you and the store, then they leave their mess for you to clean up with notes for the next set of managers filled with fact less opinion. They are not offering hours that any normal family based person can maintain, as well as not offering enough hours to get the benefits package I mentioned as a Pro, so great for college kid.

Pay is higher than any any other retail store for crew and they offer about $1.00 a year in raises.
Good benefits for 30 hours of more per week.
Company gives employees a chance to voice their opinion with yearly surveys.
Great atmosphere. Fun. Co-workers are really great people.
Captains can be really cool. They like to hire easy going people that match the vibe at TJ's.
Some stores work with your schedule while others do not. It just depends on the management.
I really enjoyed this job and my co-workers were great! Met some awesome people.","It's retail. Customers were generally very nice, but once in awhile you have to deal with the crazy customers. Hours are all over the place, especially for management who work at least one turn around shift a week (close at 10:00 at night only to be back early morning 4-6:00 am). I think those types of schedules should be illegal. Seriously messes with your body. 
IT""S AN INCREDIBLY PHYSICAL JOB! If you work the morning shifts your body, especially your back gets worked. Loads of back injuries from young to old people. I am nursing a back injury now. Breaking down pallets day after day can really take it's toll. Plus you have to do it quickly in order to have the store ready for customers. When the store cuts back hours, there are fewer workers but the work load is the same. Injuries are way too common because you have to do things very quickly with fewer workers, leaving less time to lift things the right way. 
Management is kind of a mess right now. Mates that are hired from the outside make close to 2 times the amount as those who are promoted from within the company. So those who have proven themselves to be exceptional workers by working their way up the ladder end up making far, far less money than those who are hired from Walmart and Target. It causes a lot of turn over in the management positions. Lots of Mates step down to crew members or go on to higher paying management jobs elsewhere. This problem could go away if TJ's would pay all incoming managers the same and be more transparent reguarding pay. Why not pay all starting Mates the same and at least start them at the top of the crew member scale? Seriously pay them enough so they don't have to have another job to survive. It's hard enough to work that crazy 50 hour a week schedule with the crazy hours. At least pay them for it!"

Co workers are usually fun to work with, but keep in mind that many say they work there only because there's no drug testing policy.","Each store has a quota of people to dump from insurace per quarter.  To do that they over-hire and manipulate hours.  If it were a fair process it would be one thing.  But most of the best employees and people who ""make things happen"" get hours cut to one day a week if the DayForce software targets them as being next to go off of insurance.  Each store has a core group of employees who've baby-sat managers kids, sold them drugs, or are personal freinds.  Those people consistently get all the shifts they want AND what hours they chose to work..  Everyone else is regarded as disposeable and managerment can care less about their value to the company."

The culture is one that is caring, training based, and supportive of all that work there. Promotions come from within first, if you have the ambition, you will get noticed and have an opportunity for advancement. Company goes out of the way to hold on to great employees.",Entitled employees that expect things vs. appreciating them. There isn't a clear cut attendance & performance structure in place. Makes it hard to hold poor performers accountable.
4690,Trader Joe's,Trader Joes Employee experience,2015-06-10,4.0,Crew Member,It is a lucrative company that offers excellent health benefits to those who average 30+ hrs a week. Its fun and feels more like a party than working lol. Raises usually happen every six months and are for a decent amount verses .35 a year,However it is still very low in pay in regards to someone who has a family to support or isn't living at home with parents who pay most the bills. Guess you can negotiate so it varies per person. The hours are all over the place and can be tough if you have a family. You can talk with managers and get hours within your availability however the less availability the less ours given and the less pay made.

Which means we are trained to do everything from cleaning, stocking, cashiering etc. Raises are every 6 months and are easy to get if you just follow directions. They cap out at $21.50 now, I believe. 10% employee discount. The opportunity to have weekly food and wine tastings.",It's customer service so it can be mentally draining. And breaking down palet's will be hard on your body in the long run trust me! The managers at times speak at you instead og to you. The Captain always acts nice but is only looking at you like a number and thinking of ways to get more work out of you without correct compensation.The company is also taking a more corporate approach looking at numbers and how to squeeze one more profit out of us. I feel we no longer embody the neighborhood grocery store. With the addition of Obamacare TJS decided to mess with our health care benefits and make us eligible for medical benefits if were worked an average of 30 hrs a week instead of the previous 20. This hurt a lot of college students who were attending school fulltime. They blamed the change on Obamacare  but in reality they just wanted to save money.

 The company is good the store I work at is the problem.","My trader Joes has to be the worst store I have ever worked in. The crew is horrible, the management is horrible, and I am desperately looking to transfer like NOW. When I started working at trader Joes almost a year ago it was not so bad. I really liked the company but after a while things went from bad to worst. My caption doesn’t like anything; it took him almost a year to finally get a banana stand. He does not interact with the crew, 90 percent of the times it seems like he has no clue what he’s doing or he will stand in the store and watch crew members BUT will not tell them what they are doing  wrong instead he will tell a mate who THEN will tell the crew member what they did wrong. The store has the potential be a great store but the management suck so bad it will never happen. My caption just recently started interacting with the crew but only after the reviews. 

The whole store acts as if they are in high school crewmembers telling on other crewmembers instead of doing their job and focusing on the customers.  Mates stepping in and pulling people to the side saying, ”Well so and so said this” I feel its so high school. There’s also WAY too much drama at this store (but I think that’s at every job). Sometimes I just want to come to work and do my job without being sucked into drama or picking up the stack because someone is always calling out. There’s no diversity in this store either. 

I feel underappreciated most of the time. Once you work a section and your good at it YOUR STUCK IN THAT SECTION. I cant tell you how many times I worked produce everyday, every morning, I break down 6,7 sometimes 8 pallets by myself because some crewmembers spend half the day talking and are barely productive. I don’t mind working produce it just a little variety would be nice. The mates at my store talking about getting me out of produce so I can be a more well rounded crewmember but it has yet to happen."
4722,Trader Joe's,Life as a crew member,2015-05-22,2.0,Full Time Crew Member,"Awesome coworkers, casual, fun, silly. When everyone communicates, honestly, and everyone is working productively, things go a lot smoother. The supervisors are usually awesome in many ways, some way more then others. Even they turn against each other often times","Lots of secrecy, and back stabbing, that includes management. Often times management creates a such a strong division between the employees by playing into blatant favoritism and this creates a somewhat hostile working environment. Also, when it comes time for the once every 6 months review, management looks and searches for any little reason to not give employees a $.60 raise. This lasts for an entire 6 months. For instance an employee can be a very strong and productive worker, but maybe has one small area of needing improvement, that employee won't get the raise for at least another 6 months. A lot of this has to do with keeping payroll and store cost down so the higher up management receive their large bonuses. On top of their already 6 figure salary. When employees are not feeling as if they are valued for all their hard work, it will eventually show in the quality of work and dedication. Also many new employees are getting hired at least $1 and up more then many employees who have worked there for years, simply because minimum wage went up so hiring wage goes up, but should existing wages go up as well to reflect the difference"

At the end of the day, it's still a retail chain corporation. Decisions about how the store should be run are generally made above the store level; i.e. not by people working in the store.

- the crew becomes like your family, as you really spend more time with these people than your actual family 
- at my store, being a hard worker gets you recognized 
- being recognized as a hard, productive worker gets you a chance to own a section and write an order for that particular section 
- the management at every particular store is very different, so if you don't like your current management, there's chances to relocate and love your job much more 
- amazing benefits; great but you'll definitely work for them
- chances to relocate almost anywhere in the United States, as there are so many stores and many more opening up every year","- the mates at my particular store tend to mistrust crew members pretty often, not allowing them to talk while they work or do what they'd like to to their owned sections
- owning a section does not mean a pay raise, so basically this means much more work and stress for the same pay (or technically, the normal two flat rate raises per year) 
- this job requires constant physical labor, very rough on the body after a while 
- if you're not planning on becoming part of the management team, this job is pretty much dead-end
- for the amount of daily physical labor that is required, the pay is less than adequate
- availability must be completely open for you to get hours, this means that there is almost no time for a social/personal/school life
- during the slow season, hours can and will be tremendously cut and the management at my store uses silly excuses to explain why YOUR particular hours have been reduced 
- you must work 30 or more hours a week to receive benefits; if you have your hours cut, you can easily lose those benefits 
- customers can be extremely over bearing 
- favoritism is very apparent, nobody at my store has been horribly mistreated, however, I've heard of that being the case at other stores 
- sexism is very apparent; almost every male that I work with gets paid more than most females, even if they haven't worked for the company as long 
- the work days are pretty long and strenuous, 8 hours of straight physical labor isn't good for the body or mind 
- you will absolutely not work a set schedule, sometimes you'll work a shift starting at 5:00 am and the next day you'll be scheduled at 3:00 pm until 11:00 pm and then the next day you'll have to come in at 10:00 am and work until 6:00 pm."

Annual party is fun","* No defined culture. Anyone can behave anyway they want. Several law suits against TJ as a result of the former loose cannon Controller. Her boss, the COO, let her ruin peoples life's / careers due to her outbursts and intimidation tactics. Her staff won't even participate in meeting discussions, afraid they will get fired if they speak up. 
* IT is a mess and the last priority for TJ. No disaster recovery, all software is out of version, and the IT VP is creating a smoke and mirror environment where everyone is frightened and knows he says one thing and does another. Very calculated killer, and willing to do anything to make himself look better while crushing others.   
* Dan walks around the open / cubical environment with his hands in his pockets, finds 2 people discussing an important issue and says ""Do you know why conference rooms were invented?""
* Office furniture is old, falling apart and chairs are back killers and dust is built up every where creating an unhealthy environment
* Conference rooms on the executive side are ""unaccessible"" for meetings because they are next to the executives - and there are not enough conference rooms. Lots of meetings are held outside. If the TJ University is in session, then there is no where to meet. 
* Scheduling Conf rooms is straight out of the 1950's. No integration with Outlook, per Dan. A binder with 3 months worth of dates for all the rooms is kept in the lobby. A complete waste of time and inefficient for all involved, again, upper management's head in the clouds not caring about how this impacts productivity. 
* TJ prides itself on not adding headcount, but adding more work to the people. This creates a lopsided work/life balance, frustration and a feeling of upper management being out of touch. 
* Complacency is rampant. No one cares, no one wants to give any suggestions, and most of the people have been employed for 20+ years and are so out of touch with the outside world, it is a throw back in time. 
* Annual ""anonymous"" gallop survey for the main office not favorable. Dan called all Managers together and told them ""If you don't like it hear, the door is over there, go ahead and leave now"". Very telling - and self describes the culture Dan and his inner circle create."

There are extremely dedicated employees who go above and beyond their duties to make sure the store is in the best shape it could be in.","I have seen this company go from what I considered a role model to other companies to being just one of the many rather than one of the few, as it used to be. Their ever- expanding market has created many different rules about your daily job that makes it impossible to properly communicate with one another. Due to the new healthcare system, you must work 30 hours versus the previous 20 to receive health insurance. Just about every other person hired at this particular store are southern baptists. Our captain has turned a blind eye to the tension this creates in the work environment. I have seen maybe four people of color hired during the time I've been employed there. Every single one of them has left eventually. There were about 70 people who opened our store and three years later there are about ten original hires left. I've heard other stores do not have near as high of a turnover rate as ours.

Our store captain puts his personal views before the company's, by hiring mostly young religious white males (or their wives, or both), who receive better treatment than the older employees, and the female employees.

The mates at this particular store are so miserable and it is a reflection of poor guidance from the captain. They're not properly trained, therefore crew members aren't properly trained. All of the original mates that opened our store have left (ten of them) to work at a different store because they knew months into the job that they were in no way going to receive a recommendation to move up in the company by this captain.

If I were to write this review when I first started the job, it would have gone much, much differently. Many crew members who couldn't get an issue resolved by our captain took it to our regional director, who also turned a blind eye to their array of concerns. 

I worked with a gay man who came out as transgender two years into the job. As soon as she came out, her reviews were bad, her hours were cut, and the treatment from our management changed toward her. Prior to that, her reviews were always perfect. This is one of the many examples as to why Trader Joe's will either get worse, or if they start listening, REALLY listening, it could get better."
4792,Trader Joe's,Section Leader,2015-03-23,4.0,,"Trader Joe's is not publicly-traded and the management decisions are made within each of the stores. The atmosphere is fun and lively.

Health Insurance is only $60/per month and if an employee is over 30, the company automatically puts up the equivalent of 10% of their annual salary into a 401K on the employee's behalf.",This is still a retail job.  The customers will push employees a little harder than in regular grocery stores because they view our courtesy and friendliness as a weakness.

They have their favorites and it's becoming very frustratingly obvious. To be working so hard, and feeling so proud of yourself- but still consistantly told you're not doing a good job really gets to you after awhile. Especially when other mates are congradating you on your great work that day. To me, I know I'm not doing anything wrong. So I'm not mad at myself, I'm angry with how they are able to do this. I know I'm not the only one this is happening to at my store, which is sad to me that other people are going thru it as well. Now; I don't ( and didn't ever ) see myself working at Trader Joes for the rest of my life, that being said, I was super excited to sign up for the experience that I had heard about working there, and all the fun that would come out of it. My captain once told me that this job isn't rocket science then proceeding to basically call me ( for lack of a better term ) stupid for the rest of the 15 minute meeting, which ended with a final warning due to an issue that was a mistake and not even a big deal AT ALL. I had never been in trouble before so a final warning made no sense to me. Over time my hours decreased even though I had been working very hard only to go un-noticed. I'm very disappointed with how I am treated and thinking of taking it to corporate. I feel worthless at this company because they know that if anyone quits they'll have a new person in the following day. They really don't care about their staff."

There is always something good at demo and as long as the employee isn't busy or needed elsewhere and it isn't too busy at the demo station (also depending on how long the prep is for the product being demoed), there is generally a chance during the day to give the demo a try.

Relevant to the previous, since customer satisfaction and product knowledge are so important, there are often bi-weekly if not weekly food tastings, as well as less frequent beer and/or wine tastings as well as other opportunities to try products you haven't tried before or are new.  

Very tight knit crews. There are of course egos, but crew members working together for the common good is part of Trader Joe's core ethos so the crew will always pull together to get the task done when needed.","Not really a con but you will work hard, very hard, and there is a lot of pressure to get your assigned task done, even if it means working all the way up to the eight hour limit after time for lunch is deducted.  Also, a lot of lifting and awkward movements with boxes/items is expected and required for the job.

As stated above, there are egos among both the crew members and the mates (assistant managers) which lead to difficulties. In addition, there is often a lot of inconsistency as to how policies are implemented from mate to mate, not to mention how strictly they are adhered to."

4816,Trader Joe's,The hardest job I ever had.,2015-02-27,2.0,F/T Crew Member,Most employees super nice and always willing to help answer customer questions. Always food in the break room for all to eat. High quality products at fair prices. Was so excited to work there initially. Open to hiring anyone. The pay seemed good until one realized how hard the work was.,Every hour you work you are doing something different and you must be working full blast. The managers plan out where every employee will be every hour of the day. Very disconcerting. Had to always watch the time then start doing a completely different task. Had to write down every shift and every hour to be where they wanted us to be. Some of the workers were just miserable people. Some dept. managers extreme in how they wanted produce displayed but would comment after all the work was done that it was wrong. Work hours all over the place either in at 5 a.m. or 6 a.m. and tons of work done after the store closes.  I have always worked very hard putting out stock on delivery day but this company receives truck daily. Very hard labor every day. Some managers very fussy. No drug tests often wondered if coworkers were stoned. No place for employees to park was told might have to use parking garage not even visible from the store. Only certain employees allowed to talk during the shift - that is what it felt like.

4818,Trader Joe's,Nice clean store/employees.,2015-02-24,4.0,,Decent benefits fun people to work with.,It's weight lifting job so expect to move some decent weight.
4819,Trader Joe's,"It's great if you can get a good captain, otherwise it's just pretty good.",2015-02-11,4.0,F/T Crew Member,"It's a relaxed culture where you can be yourself with tattoos, different hair and unique personalities (as long as you're not crabby to the customers or your crewmates). It also has a really good starting salary (especially if you have previous retail experience). As part of the Crew, you don't specialize. You will work ALL ASPECTS OF TRADER JOE'S. Everyone, from the Captain to the Mates (asst. mgrs.) to the Crew, works register, unloads trucks, stocks shelves, greets customers, works Demo (where they give food samples) and cleans up. TJ's stresses product knowledge, so we have food and wine tastings weekly.

AND if you make TJ's your career, you can have a very good life, because the Mates make VERY GOOD MONEY ($50k to $90k) and the Captains ($90k+). It's not brain surgery, folks, but if you like people and are friendly and helpful (and patient with others), you will really like Trader Joe's. Oh, yeah, I almost forgot. The benefits are good (in CA, 700 hrs a year qualifies you for health insurance) and for those under 30, you get a yearly bonus (but for those over 30, you get the bonus as an IRA contribution).","Like any job, the job is only as good as its leader, and if you get a crappy Captain or lazy mates, the days can suck. The Captain at my store had 30+ years with the company, but was the most indecisive man I'd ever met. Today this, tomorrow that. It made things confusing. Also some of the Mates came in as managers, so they weren't promoted up from crew. THAT makes a huge difference! The crew would often get angry that they didn't pitch in to help enough due to a perceived sense of entitlement. Then whoever writes the schedule says our sales are low and cuts Crew on the busiest days. We all have to rush around and some have gotten hurt (including me), but we should be grateful to have a job, right?

Those who work smart aren't always rewarded, while those who have been with the company more than five years seem to put their feet up and do as much of the work as they want to. They have the best shifts, yet the majority aren't the best workers. This leads to a cascade effect where work not done or done incorrectly falls on YOU. And like every other job, there is favoritism, but as long as it doesn't affect my money, I don't care.

Oh, and the customers. The majority (85%) are nice, but the others? You have to bite your tongue and be kind when you get insulted, treated rudely or yelled at. Remember: the customer is always right, even if they're a ranting nutjob."

company minimum wage is $10.00 and hour",All the captains are given pretty much free reign over their store so they can either make a store really enjoyable or a nightmare. Unfortunately this store is a nightmare. Mates are encouraged to be degrading and micromanage. People are often rewarded and promoted by sucking up or gossiping about fellow crew members. You can meet some really awesome upbeat people here but you unfortunately can't trust anyone. Very hard to have your ideas heard or valued. Hours aren't very good if you want to have a personal life.

You really can build long-term friendship here. Also, benefit isn't what it used to be but it's still great!","No work/life balance once you became a mate. Be prepared for with lots of drama and politics - it's inevitable in a close-knitted work place. You can avoid it when you are a crew member, but you'll have to play the game once you're a mate, just to survive."
4827,Trader Joe's,Crew Member,2015-02-11,4.0,Crew Member,"Trader Joe's has a great environment! 90% of crew members, mates, and captains are very upbeat and put in lots of effort to keep stores running smoothly. There's lots of flexibility for hours and it's not a dead-end job. If you work hard you can get raises and if you choose to, becoming a mate isn't incredibly difficult. Most people just work here for the time being and move one though. 

There's a TJ culture that some would call cult-like. I think it's nice that there's a community at my job. It's welcoming and at times over-bearing, but still nice to experience.","It's a very labor-intensive job. I use an app on my phone to track the distance I walk in a day. It ranges anywhere from 4-8 miles in a 8 hour shift. This includes standing at the registers and taking my lunch breaks. There's also lots of lifting involved and constant bending up and down. Everyone has to be very conscious of how they are working because injuries happen and they happen often. I come home with a sore back, shoulders, arm, legs, and feet. Some days it's worse than others."

If you like helping people, cooking (or eating good food), and working hard...Trader Joe's is an awesome place to work!  Benefits are pretty awesome too.","Depending on the store, some coworkers can be a little sensitive about what they're asked to do.  And the ""work life balance"" can be a little difficult for people needing specific time's for work.  As Trader Joe's schedules according to the ""needs of the customer.""  So if you have open availability you most likely with fit right in."
4834,Trader Joe's,"This is a grocery store, don't expect to hang out and drink coffee all day.",2014-12-20,4.0,Part Time Crew Member,"Most crew members are nice to work with; mates at my store are friendly and supportive, great captain who is humble enough to work on the floor and to stand in line when shopping for himself, eat with the crew and talk to everyone.

I like that in case of disagreements, the mates or the captain are able to keep an unbiased viewpoint, or so it seems.

I find that the ""attendance policy"" with warnings etc. is very fair. Serves well, if one has an emergency or a major problem where they can't exactly bring ""doctors notes"" etc. And the the records of the offences are being erased after 90 days.

Generally speaking, I really like going to work and am looking forward to it (and I am generally a very picky person as far as employers go).

We don't get too many obnoxious or self-entitled customers. Occasionally you'll get them, but that's not a norm.

10% off groceries and booze is nice! So is a 401k plan. (Not sure if I will get a health plan because I am not planning to reach 30 hrs/ week work load.)

Generally speaking, this is a great place to work and I believe that if one has the right personality and will, it's also a great place to be promoted to a mate level. Other than that, yeah, this is a grocery store, the work is physical and it's not paid like if you were a Wall Street banker or a marketing manager. However, I think one can learn different aspects of running a grocery store here for a better than average in industry wage and I think that if someone is looking for a less physical job for more pay, they should just meanwhile look for something more fitting. Many better paying jobs actually require or consider retail experience very important and Trader Joe's is one of the better companies to acquire that experience. My two cents...","I am nitpicking here, really.

Basically what they want (at least in my store) is part-time workers with full-time workers' commitment in all aspects - time commitment, emotional commitment, dedication and loyalty. That can feel pretty ""soul-sucking"" or like a ""cult"", as others have described and is pretty much the reason why I'm rating TJ's with 4 stars. The antidote to this issue is to come in and do the best you can, but have the guard up enough to not be sucked out of your shell at the end of the day.
 
They emphasize how they value ""having life outside work"", but it can be problematic to get a particular evening off if you are typically scheduled for closing shifts - even if you have an almost open availability to work at different times of day as well.

Apparently morning shifts are almost exclusively reserved for ""seasoned crew members"" (people who have worked for TJ's 5+ years) and so are, apparently, for a big part, day shifts.

From what I hear, injuries are common. Do yourself a favor, get decent shoes. You will get run over by crew members with two-wheelers, by customers with shopping carts etc. Also, you should stretch and learn about safe lifting techniques. There is no official training on safety so your best bet is to talk to the ""seasoned crew members"" who will 99% of the time be open to educate you on one-on-one basis about safety and injury prevention. Although, in the 10-day training everyone will generally talk about safety and if you ask, they will show you how to lift etc. Also - get decent gloves because you will work in frozen section from time to time.

Prepare to over-use a hand sanitizer or come down sick often. Why? Because you will handle cash and many of the ""seasoned crew members"" have warned that that's where catching a flu comes from. Also - wearing plastic gloves is not permitted at the check-out. (Some customers complained about feeling offended to deal with cashiers who wear gloves a few years ago so they prohibited wearing gloves at the checkout. Not strictly enforced though, from what I see and hear.)  
 
I don't like their confrontation tactics which because I find them intimidating: they will approach you out of blue, lead you outside and confront you and there will always be a ""witness"" mate with the main person who confronts. I understand why the system makes sense, but just be aware of it as it can get very uncomfortable."

4836,Trader Joe's,A great company to work for if you are in college,2015-02-08,4.0,Part Time Crew Member,Trader Joe's stores have a very friendly atmosphere where even though you are doing physically demanding job but you are still having a good time.

It's very easy to get transfer from store to store across the country if you are doing a good job.,"It's a very physically demanding job. Crew members are required to lift up heavy boxes up to 40 pounds and break grocery pellets. It's not easy for older employees.

Depending on the captain/full timers and the overall store, the crew member climate has a tendency to differ significantly.  Although benefits change and evolve, the captain has the ability to manipulate matters and provide direction tempering negative outcomes and lasting damage."
