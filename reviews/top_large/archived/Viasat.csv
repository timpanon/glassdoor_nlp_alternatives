1,Viasat,Don't even bother to try working with HR,2022-03-17,2.0,Senior Software Engineer,"Decent place for an engineer overall. The work is interesting and there are smart people on the engineering teams. There are some ""us vs. them"" attitudes from people who have been with the company a long time. From what I hear it used to be much better 10+ years ago.","They are struggling like most companies which is no surprise with the supply chain issues. 

HR is the group to avoid here. From the beginning, it was about working around 
HR to get to talk with the hiring manager (I applied - did not hear back from anyone for a couple of weeks. I then reached out to a manager on LinkedIn who passed along my resume to the hiring manager who called me right away). After that, it was the hiring manager and the team that pushed to make things happen (not HR). Even after you're hired they seem to have no interest in being a part of your success or helping you unless there is something in it for them that makes them look good or if you are part of senior leadership. They definitely do not walk the talk."
2,Viasat,"Pay is so good, but no training or structure to new hires in Software",2022-04-04,3.0,Software Engineer New Grad,"Pay is amazing for a new hire right out of school

Office is nice and food is good, although they make you pay for it.","401k is terrible. 50% match.(most decent tech companies do 100%match, yet these people do 50%)

No training structure or training at all for software roles. First few months I just came into work with no idea what i would be doing for the day besides meetings. Just had to act busy . Im happy with what I do now being here for a year and half but like i said first bit was rough without a training on how to code/test/projects/do things. I had to self teach everything to just keep up.

Unlim time off but never been able to use it without mgmt getting upset when I took time off."
3,Viasat,Runs like a start up without any of the perks of a start up,2022-03-17,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Viasat is a place where there is a lot of opportunity to do anything you want. If you have an interest, you can fit in and do almost anything. When you start out, its very exciting.","Unfortunately, Viasat is a place where everything you do thats above and beyond immediately (and retroactively) becomes part of your job. There are a VERY small number of people who get recognition for the hard work of a lot of people. It doesn't matter if you work 32hrs or 52hrs a week, the upper management will tell you that you must work harder. You can never grow because all growth is not career advancement and all hard work is rewarded with much more work. 

Also, compensation: small raises, tiny bonuses and 401k matched in stock (search VSAT, if you're curious about that last one)."
4,Viasat,A company that cares,2022-03-22,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"There's opportunity to grow internally, passionate leaders that care about their employees, and innovative, groundbreaking work with a vision to connect the world. 

Throughout my time at Viasat, I have not been bound to one role or had to stay in my own lane. Even in the midst of shifting to a virtual setting due to COVID-19, there has been collaboration, the desire to help employees succeed, and new projects to take on.",Implementing change can sometimes take longer than expected.
5,Viasat,"The promise of a promotion is always there, but something will always come up",2022-01-27,2.0,Monitoring & Dispatch,"Job security,
Diversity of both technical and communication skills,
Looks good on resume due to military and VIP interactions.","They will promise you a promotion, even give you a date and tell you to tell your family, then on the day of your promotion will say ""well, corporate will not approve leaving M&D yet as we need all hands to maintain our current contracts"". Happened 3 times, 3 dropped promotions. Each time I asked when we would get more staff so that I could move on. First time: 3 months, Second time: a year, Third time: and least 2 years if things go smoothly. 

Lower tier agents are treated as inferior human beings. People are downright derogatory, and while M&D experiences much less of it than floor agents they themselves often turn around in their own seats to fight each other. While this makes the work place toxic, the real culprit is management. Teams are understaffed, overworked, and have to maintain mountains of SLAs and documentation at the same time."

10,Viasat,Rember to be grateful for those who built you,2022-02-28,4.0,Engineer,Technically challenging so a good place to innovate. We are allowed to contribute.,"Our GM in Atlanta made a comment at an all-hands meeting that wasn't respectful of the people that have contributed to the success of our company. He said that a recent interviewer looking for a job said he wouldn't work for us because we were just a bunch of ""old white guys"". I'm not a racist and we as a company welcome anyone that has the qualifications. Something like this can be dealt with behind the scenes rather than making the majority of the people that have contributed to the success of the company feel unwanted."
11,Viasat,Great company,2022-03-22,5.0,Internship,The company was great and onboarding made things very clear. Would recommend applying here.,I wasn’t there long enough (internship) to see and cons.
12,Viasat,Great Company to Work For,2022-01-17,5.0,RF/Microwave Test Engineer,"Great pay - Viasat's compensation department analyzes market competitors and adjusts where necessary. Supplemented with stock/cash bonuses, employee stock purchase program, and other opportunities.

401k - good retirement match ($0.50 per dollar up to 10%)

Health insurance, vision, dental, emergencies - no complaints

Gym membership reimbursement (there is also an onsite gym), wellness reimbursements, onsite health screenings, flu shot clinics

Unlimited PTO, great work life balance, team ethic

Transparency - small teams with large individual responsibility give you visibility

Challenging work - we will change the world","Lack of transparency regarding career advancement opportunities; however, the engineering department is working on creating a structured development program

Lack of talent pipeline esp. in Arizona location. Some people who are under-credentialed (lack of education, training) are either directly hired or promoted into integration/test engineering positions."

14,Viasat,"Great work life balance, bleak future",2022-03-16,5.0,Wireless Engineer,Flexibility and work life balance,Poor compensation and lot of competition in the space
15,Viasat,Company culture only good (was) at Carlsbad,2022-01-08,3.0,Maintenance Controller,"Great benefits ( the health insurance alone is worth it), In Carlsbad pre-covid we will have great company parties, bicycles to ride between buildings, a very college campus vibe.","HR department called People and Culture stated ""We are not here to protect employees only the company."" You can be fired for missing one day of work even if you worked the day. Very secretive pay scales. Such a large disparity of pay between coworkers who all start in the same time frame ( this can be a pro if you are lucky). Do to the under staffment they will swap your schedule around one day to the next"
16,Viasat,"A fantastic company to start, grow, and finish your career",2022-01-12,5.0,Senior Staff Engineer,"* Great work-life-balance. It's built-in to the culture to be accommodating. I never feel bad about taking time off, shifting work hours for my family, or taking wellness breaks. I rarely work more than 40h/week. If I end up working on a weekend, I usually work fewer hours during the week to balance the ledger. That said, I'm happy to put in extra hours in those rare times when it's really needed.
* Massive tech stack. You can do hardware, software, radio-frequency, enterprise, cloud, physics, government, and so much more. You will never run out of things to learn.
* Lots of autonomy. The culture does not encourage micromanagement, hierarchies, or rigidity. Our mantra is ""Do the right thing"".
* Constantly evolving. This company was started in the 80s by people who are still around. They have learned to continually adapt and evolve despite huge changes around them. This company isn't going anywhere, and keeps getting better the longer you're around.
* Upwards mobility for high-performers. If you're a star employee, the sky is the limit. If you just want to punch your timecard and chill, then expect your compensation and promotions to reflect that.","* The teams can sometimes feel like a bunch of small startups. This has benefits, but it also means that your experience could vary from team to team depending on who the managers and teammates are. Not all teams will be the right fit for you.
* Another mantra is something along the lines of ""Resilience in Ambiguity"". It means some of the answers you seek will not be available, and you'll need to make decisions, and take responsibility for them. This works well for some people, and not as well for others.
* There is a lack of transparency around compensation and titles. This is improving, but will take time.
* Viasat is a globally distributed business. This also means we operate in lots of timezones, and you sometimes have to work with people who are very far from you. You may need to be flexible about when you work if you're in this situation."

There are some exceptions, but, generally, people don’t ping you late at night or expect you to work on vacation.","While there are a lot of opportunities to improve processes or  solve problems, the opportunities for advancement are less clear. If you’re ambitious and seek them out aggressively, they come pretty easy. If you’re hoping someone will give you a path for you to follow, you’ll be disappointed. I’ve seen the biggest determinate of a person’s perception of advancement at Viasat is their direct manager. I know high performers who left because their manager was not supportive and an advocate for them."

32,Viasat,No rules = a double-edged sword,2021-10-10,3.0,Manager,"They talk a lot about opacity and ambiguity, and you can really use these elements of the culture to your advantage. People are responsive to new ideas, executives make time to hear them, and most people you work with genuinely care.","The biggest problem is that people can use those same values of opacity and ambiguity against you. I was treated so cruelly by a recently-hired VP that HR intervened when they saw it (of their own volition) but they were powerless to act because there are no rules. The worst experience of my career, bar none. I resigned. Trust and discretion are laudable, but if you can't protect a high-performing, longstanding employee from mistreatment, you have a problem. Once you see how much damage a single bad hire can do at Viasat, you'll sour on this passion for ambiguity too. It's a shame but for that reason, I can't recommend it as a place to work. It's fun until you find out you have no recourse against a bad manager, and no one has your back."

Viasat helps monetarily with certifications and gets you licenses for anything you can provide a business reason for so you can expand your skill set. If you ask for more challenging work and then do it well, you can use that to negotiate for a role change our promotion. Internal promotions are very common.


Good benefits. There is a gym, several snack bars and coffee lounges, plenty of networking opportunities, stock options, 401ks, all the insurance, elevate, lots of access to education and nice facilities. Some departments also did raffles and parties before the pandemic hit.

Compensation is fair, but I definitely recommend trying to negotiate for a higher salary  than offered. Be reasonable with this and do your research first. Sometimes they are legitimately offering the highest they are able to because of pre-determined and approved guidelines that are outside their control. The worst that happens is they say no anyway, but more often than that they will just ask why you deserve it. Have one good reason, and they'll either up the offer or get back to you after speaking with their boss.","Departments sometimes feel isolated from each other. This occasionally results in the right people not getting the memo and projects getting delayed due to missing information and misaligned priorities.

The higher l you go up the chain, the more time you should expect to dedicate to work. My best advice is to be very upfront about how many hours you are willing to work a week of you're salary. This will also help if you're worried about the ""and other responsibilities"" in a job description.

A layoff happened at the beginning of the pandemic that I'm sure affected a lot of people negatively. Most of those that were still there had to pick up additional work during the pandemic and multiple large projects."

There is very little attention paid to growth in the job. There are so many engineers it is easy to get lost. I worked there for seven years and never got on the good side of the key players. A lot of ego and unwillingness to share knowledge.
84,Viasat,Treats their employees right,2021-07-09,5.0,Software Engineer,"Viasat very much wants to retain their employees and will treat you well. In the year I’ve worked here, I’ve seen probably around 15 people hired onto my team and only 1 leave the company. You get unlimited sick time and they recently switched to an unlimited vacation policy as well. Pretty much every benefit under the sun (health, dental, vision, life insurance, short and long term disability, etc) for FREE if you are on the high deductible health plan. Throughout COVID employees have been working from home as much as is possible. At the end of my first year of working here, my salary is already 6% higher then where I started, partially from my annual performance review and partially from a “market based” adjustment (even though I was already making well over the average for the area from my research). Dress code is casual (depending on the office, shorts may even be common). No one will expect you to work excessive hours unless there is a very good reason, and even then only infrequently. I’ve had maybe 3 really hectic weeks where I worked significantly more than 40 hours since I started. Management is grateful for this extra effort rather than expecting it.","We always seem to be behind schedule and right down to the wire, to the point where I have occasionally had to work a late night or over the weekend to fix a bug that was discovered at the last minute during testing. Management is always very nice and grateful for extra effort in these situations, but it would be good if we didn’t end up in last minute panic situations."

Aside from the healthy culture, this good review comes mostly from the fact that, in 2020 when when all airline-centric revenue was hit hard and some competitors were undergoing large scale layoffs (%40+), Viasat cut the absolute minimum (%3 I think?) and even continued standard cost of living raises in 2020. It shows a strong commitment and stable business practices.","There is definitely some political nonsense in the upper echelons here, but you're going to see that in any company this large.

Nobody shames you for switching projects. Offices were very nice. Very remote friendly. Travel opportunities. Interesting products and industry. Good benefits package. Lots of young people. I love Carlsbad.

Work life balance is very good.","Viasat used to be my dream job. During COVID, that went away. While execs laid folks off they also took on big bonuses and gave remaining employees poor raises. Lots of brain drain occuring recently, especially with high performance individual contributors. Senior leadership is an out of touch old boys club.

There's two kind of employees at Viasat: the lifer and the new grad. Viasat does not tend to hire many middle career engineers from outside. That'd be far too expensive compared to a new grad or overseas. This means nobody is cross pollinated. It's the ""it's always been done this way"" or the highway.

The culture at Viasat is very plastic. P&C/HR will tell you what the culture is: ""fun, innovative, embrace ambiguity, etc."" In reality, the culture is one of chaos, an embrace of mediocrity, and under resourced. Often when a company boasts about there own culture like Viasat does, that's when you know it's manufactured. Truth be told it's not the worst culture of anywhere I've worked, but it's not the happy go lucky utopia HR/P&C says that it is. They'll brag about all the corporate development and leadership trainings that you can't do because you're too busy completing JIRA tickets.

Advancement and growth opportunities are foggy. Some managers are very good at sharing and helping you grow. Others not so much. Embrace ambiguity! Additionally, lots of internal politics on commerical side.

Pay is just average to below average. Don't expect to earn top dollar, even if you work hard enough to."

Essentially no stress on the job, it's all about building awesome stuff. You can even work extra hours earlier in the week to take off work later! In addition, it's very easy to work remote some days if you wish.

Every manager I knew was always super helpful, friendly, and encouraging.
 Everyone I worked with was genuinely funny, smart, and a blast to be with. 

The pay was pretty great, and interns get housing + a flat relocation bonus, which increases the further you are from the office you'll work in.  There were also a ton of awesome intern events, like jet skiing, movie nights, etc.

The campus at Carlsbad was super awesome and fun to be in. You're a very short drive away from the beach at all times!

There are dozens of company bikes you can use to go from one building to another. Free snacks and coffee everywhere. A fun outdoor area, including dart boards and a ping pong table among other things. A pretty dope slide.  And generally a very nice office space. I had my own office as an intern, although not everyone did. 

I also personally worked on a super fun and interesting Hololens project. 

It was a great time, I highly recommend a Viasat internship.","The lack of overall structure can make some projects much less efficient than they should be.  Also, intern 401K/the stock plan thing were laid out in a confusing manner, they were presented as if they were options when they really weren't. 

Also, the campus was huge and getting from one place to another to talk to someone wasted a lot of time."

244,Viasat,Viasat...a great place to call home,2020-04-24,5.0,Director of Service Assurance,"I spent over 7 years with Viasat and even on a bad day this was a great place to call home.  That event includes the day I was released from employment during the Covid National Emergency.  

During my tenure, I was treated fairly and given the opportunity to do what I needed to do to accomplish my job.  I was  directly led by a person that set a great leadership example (Thanks Jim E.)  And senior leadership really challenged our teams to be accountable problem solvers (Thanks Phil, Kevin, Todd, Marc).

During the Covid 19 Emergency the company communicated well and placed the employees at the forefront of their decision making.  Having been in the communications industry for nearly 25 years I was surprised that they did not move more swiftly to cut employees.  That is a credit to the senior leadership team.  

I would highly recommend Viasat for anybody seeking employment in a fast moving technical company that pushes the limit on what is possible.",Every company has cons...but honestly there is nothing out of the ordinary.  Tools and Enterprise Systems needs to be  a focus but they only suffered because Viasat is so aggressive launching technology that it sometimes becomes hard to make that part of the business a priority.  Viasat will need to solve that problem before the network becomes so expansive that it is too big of a problem to solve easily.  True to form...they are working on that and I expect they will solve this too.

249,Viasat,Execs Out of Touch,2020-08-28,1.0,Engineer,"Great low level and mid-level managers
Great Campus
Inclusive and communicative culture in some business units (not all)","I have been at Viasat for nearly 20 years. The company has changed tremendously over that time. In the early days it was like a family and the top execs were admired since they worked along side everyone else and appreciated personal sacrifices employees made for the company. This is no longer the case. The executives have lost touch. 

When COVID hit, they promptly laid-off or furloughed hundreds of people and announced a salary freeze. Everyone could understand the rationale given by the execs at the time. But then the annual report was published in early August and it showed they accepted huge bonuses, stock awards and salary increases in June, just two months after the lay-off. 

Every colleague I talked with is outraged to see how well they were taken care of while the rest of us were asked to sacrifice and some of our most respected colleagues were shown the door. To add to the frustration, they released a surprisingly good financial report for the April-June 2020 quarter, which is not consistent with the message they gave to justify the lay-offs.

Are companies across the country not being asked to do everything possible to keep their workforce employed during these tough times? Decisions by Viasat executives are clearly being made to maximize financial performance and increase their personal wealth. All execs could have taken a 50% bonus cut and kept a hundred or more Viasat family members employed for the remainder of the year while still earning multi-million dollar compensations. To them, cash clearly wins over compassion. 

Latest rumor is they are preparing for another lay-off and elimination or reduction of benefits to further optimize company financial performance. Why? Viasat is not in financial hardship. They are doing this while many projects are short staffed and managers are not allowed to hire and constantly pushed to be more productive with fewer people.

I am personally conflicted because my team and low to mid level supervisors are great. The attitude of the top execs is now flowing down so I am actively looking for other opportunities as are many of my colleagues."

251,Viasat,Engaging and Challenging yet Laid Back,2020-03-23,5.0,RF Test Engineer,"On balance, this is a great place to work, especially coming from a fortune 100 MSO. They hire most engineers as FTEs which comes with great benefits, a nice office, and decent pay. On balance, most of the engineers here are extremely intelligent, yet willing to help and challenge you. Management gives you a LOT of freedom when it comes to both your schedule and deadlines, if you prove yourself as a harder worker. Unlimited sick days, and generous PTO. My immediate supervisors are both people I can turn to for help/advice, but also someone I enjoy talking to about non-work related topics. Overall, would recommend this place to anyone, and I am glad the laid-back San Diego culture Mark Dankberg has established out in Carlsbad, translates fairly well to their other locations. It is challenging and difficult work, but organized in a way that makes you feel accomplished.","A lot of the on-boarding programs for new employees, like matching you with a mentor to take you to lunch, are kind of useless because no one seems to follow through. HR makes an effort to identify who hasn't, but I feel like it requires throwing someone under the bus for something that should be a bit more casual. It is also a very young company on average, which is not bad, but management should make sure there are people of all experience levels on all teams."

The non-work culture can be fun and social, but the work culture and relationships are TOXIC. The organization runs like a game of survivor.  The system in place seems to promote tolerance , education and growth of its employees, but reality is not at all.  Your ability to do well depends on your ability to schmooze. Company favors white males and veterans that move up the ranks through schmoozing. Simply look at who are in upper management, especially in engineering.  If you are a skilled engineer, looking to develop technically, this place is seriously lacking in engineering quality.

365,Viasat,Much better than it used to be,2018-03-23,5.0,Software Engineer,"I was originally pretty dissatisfied with my experience at Viasat. I felt like I wasn't being listened to, I was being forgotten by my manager, and it felt like things couldn't get better.

I managed to orchestrate transferring to another department and things are MUCH better now. A big part of that was a change in supervisor, but I also think that things company-wide have generally gotten better over the last couple of years.

Communication with management is good, we've started to adopt better development practices, and I feel like I have a voice in my own career. I'm getting the ability to shape my path into what I want to do, and I'm getting support from my supervisor the whole way. I just wish it took less than 15 months for me to start feeling that way.","Things are still pretty scatterbrained. I'm not sure why we pride ourselves on our ""ability to tolerate ambiguity""; if we just sat down and properly engineered things from the beginning we wouldn't do so much monkey patching.

HR is also perennially a mess, especially our recruiting outfit; turnover is extremely high and it makes following up on candidates difficult."

369,Viasat,Choose your own adventure,2014-07-16,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"ViaSat provides just enough infrastructure for its employees that anyone with passion, initiative, and a track record of excellence in their work can find support for their career development.  Titles are not important at the company, and one's career path is not just a function of their degree plus years working.  This doesn't always line up with how people are wired; I can imagine some employees would become disgruntled if they aren't handed promotions or growth opportunities after some time has passed since their last one.

The company invests quite a bit in continuing education & development opportunities, including tuition reimbursement programs and sponsorships for advanced degrees.  The culture is very open and collaborative.  This company is full of really really smart, good people.","As the company grows and our programs become more large and complex, the average time between reassignments becomes longer.  It used to be that a program would last 6 months, or a ""long"" program was a couple years.  So one could reasonably find themselves with opportunities to switch between programs or even business units relatively regularly, if they wanted to.  Now that the programs are longer, career mobility is usually defined by moving up within a program team or discipline, with fewer opportunities to switch between product lines, disciplines, or business areas."
