Provides many benefits
Work life balance","No cons, you are valued for your work"
1,Visa Inc.,The best place to work,2022-04-01,5.0,Sr. Executive Assistant,Everything is great.  We are all respected,Work life balance is sometimes difficult
2,Visa Inc.,"Good place to work if you have 4+ years of work experience, but a challenging place to start and grow in your career",2022-03-23,3.0,Associate Solutions Manager,"Inspiring mission, access to high visibility and high impact projects","Early career roles for business side roles are essentially nonexistent for people not in the rotational program, which often cannibalized junior roles. Poor middle management, lack of accountability for tenured underperformers, pay below market for Bay Area for most non-technical roles, lots of title inflation for people with lots of work experience with no direct reports, limited innovation, uses its market position to deliver below average results for its business customers. Visa is a very revenue driven company, so that comes ahead of innovation and if your division does not make money likely because of bad division leadership, it will be shuttered and you will be let go - my division had 3 rounds of layoffs in my first two years."
3,Visa Inc.,Lots of changes going on for a waterfall company,2022-04-04,3.0,Product Manager,"Great benefits, great pay, a lot of support for it's employee's wellness from the corporate stand point.",A lot of pains that come with a waterfall company transitioning to an agile framework. Slow to make fast changes. Senior management is always changing.
4,Visa Inc.,Could Be Better,2022-03-06,3.0,Scrum Master/Agile Coach,Team members are highly skilled. Waterfall implementation and framework is exceptionally good. Folks have a firm grasp of their products and integrations as well as staying in touch with their customers and users.,"Agile transition is not occurring in areas where the company has said Agile should occur. Upper management is clinging onto Waterfall and not embracing Agile practices. Upper management sometimes comes into our Scrum ceremonies and berates team members even though they've been asked to stop. This behavior oppresses team members and hampers them from opening up and asking important questions. Consistent hurdles with management. Developers are put on multiple projects instead of being able to focus on one, but expected to be 100% on all the projects all the time -- this creates high turnover."
5,Visa Inc.,Love my job,2022-03-30,5.0,Analyst,"Best is the market 
Smart people 
A lot of resources 
Great benefits 
Cares about you career",Not flexible about remote working.
6,Visa Inc.,Amazing post-grad experience,2022-03-31,4.0,Software Engineer,"Good work-life bance, benefits, and upward mobility",Overtime is often necessary for technical support roles
7,Visa Inc.,"Like any big company, Visa has good things and bad things",2021-12-10,3.0,Director,"There is a lot about Visa to like:
- compensation is pretty good, even relative to the Bay Area
- the product basically runs itself in many ways
- interesting work that touches a huge range of human experiences and geographies
- access to an incredible amount of interesting data
- kind, empathetic people

Pro or Con depending on your point of view
- high job stability, meaning it is pretty rare that anyone is let go
- certain roles are pretty cushy
- low accountability","- Visa is an entrenched company with a lot to lose, meaning they are not willing to take risks
- Visa pays lip service to new technologies, but at the end of the day, they have a vested interest in the current system, so they aren't actually working to push forward the technical frontier
- Especially at more senior levels, the organization is intensely political. It is basically impossible to get anything done unless you know the right people (speaking as someone who actually did know the right people). And even then, the organization moves slowly
- There has been a lot of brain drain over the last 12 to 18 months
- Visa is part of the old guard in finance / payments. The leading companies of the next generation in payments are all looking for ways to work around Visa (and the networks generally). They may not be successful, but it puts Visa in the position of constantly playing defense rather than going to execute on new, interesting business opportunities"
8,Visa Inc.,A (truly) Global Company,2022-03-28,5.0,Global Sourcing Director,"Outstanding work environment.
C-level committed to provide work-life balance",Many processes and lack to appetite to take risk on key decisions

11,Visa Inc.,"No Hikes, No promotions,No Restricted Stock Units",2022-03-15,2.0,Senior Systems Administrator,Work Life balance is Ok. Good 401K match.,"No competitive pay for a company of its size.
Just Ok bonus
No Hikes 
No RSU -- Very very rare/limited
No Career growth --> They recently introduced some namesake intermediate roles to delay career growth/progression.

Understand 2020 is hard for all of us and employees didn't mind forgetting their hikes, RSUs and promotions. Same is the case for 2021 as well. fingers crossed for 2022."
12,Visa Inc.,Great upper management; low pay,2021-11-23,5.0,Senior Product Manager,Visa’s upper management has done an excellent job during COVID with transparency and taking into account people’s needs based on multiple surveys. Very focused on well being with half day Fridays through September and continuing for summers now. Excellent benefits overall including a free healthcare option and double 401K match up to 5%. Lots of opportunities within the company to explore other roles. I enjoy the ownership and exposure that comes with my team.,"Limited training for new employees, which makes networking a little difficult. Promotions seem hard to come by. Pay is low for PM, and new hires are coming in at higher pay with no sign of change for tenured employees. A “higher raise pool for market inflation” was touted for this year but appears the average was just 4% (higher than normal but definitely not in line with inflation). Turnover is increasing and I think this is a big reason why."

However, i will say that the chance to get gifted stock is a great perk. Dependent on the team there are alot of team centered events.","I think they could do better in flexibility in terms of WFH or giving more options to do a hybrid.
It could be difficult to move up within the team so you may have to jump from team to team to move up within Visa or would have to leave. Wish you were able to get better pay."

35,Visa Inc.,Big glass ceiling for women,2022-03-27,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Smart, global, mostly friendly, ownership",Cant get out of the way of itself and still has big boys club problem everywhere
36,Visa Inc.,DO NOT JOIN,2022-02-03,1.0,New Graduate Development Program (NGDP),There are no pros to the program. I suggest going to Visa as a full time associate.,"In my opinion: You are absolutely viewed as an intern at Visa. Program management is TERRIBLE and extremely restrictive. The actual purpose of the program is NOT to find a full time position, as assumed. If you find you match at Visa before the 4 rotations, you will not be allowed to convert to full time early. Also if you leave and try to come back you will be blackballed from the company. You are limited to only the options of rotations presented and nothing outside of this. You are not allowed to clock your overtime, even if your job requires working more than a 40 hour work week (which is extremely difficult giving that many team members are located across time zones). HR is open to any criticism nor feedback and favoritism is extremely prevalent. Many of the promises made when interviewing failed all expectations. This program is not ideal for any new graduate."

50,Visa Inc.,Horrible people managers ruining the company,2022-02-15,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Visa is an extremely recognizable brand and it's cool to be a part of a company that has such a global presence and has the capability to impact all corners of the world. The benefits at Visa are hard to beat, 10% 401k match, HSA match, ESPP, excellent healthcare coverage with Cigna. The work life balance is very manager / team specific.

Al, the CEO is great, he is super down-to-earth and relatable. He makes you feel genuinely cared about as an employee.","HR doesn't have a seat at the table, which in turn impacts every employee negatively. Leaders from other orgs at Visa were selected to run HR, so HR is a mess, Visa hired a chief diversity officer who left after a few months. There are awful people managers who drive entire teams and top performers out of the company, yet these managers stay in their roles with no consequences (maybe they get some weekly ""coaching"" to check a box). Visa has a ~2 hour manager training online course before allowing people to have direct reports. It's really luck of the draw if you get a good manager, so make sure to vet your manager A LOT during the interview -- ask to talk to their other direct reports. 

Visa sent a bunch of internal surveys about returning to the office and the majority of people wanted to work remotely. Instead of listening to their employees, Visa decided to have everyone return 3 days per week. Leadership is going in the office and making a big display about how great it is to try to entice people, what a joke. Everyday I see a new person on LinkedIn announce they are leaving Visa."
51,Visa Inc.,Good company but pay cannot compete,2022-02-25,4.0,Software Engineer,Great company and work life balance is great,pay - they cannot compete with top tech companies

Reasonable pay, good benefits (401K - 10% match) and an exec team that values work-life balance. Wellness Fridays, etc.","A culture that prefers status quo and is resistant to change. Keep the lights on and transactions humming is the mantra. Want to build great tech products, not the best place. Want to be in payment products, might be a good place to be, but in that case avoid technology and find a place in the business side. 
Note you will work with some very good people, but that is a minority. Under-performers remain influential at Visa and little is done to reduce their influence. In many cases these are long-tenured employees, who remain influential and stifle change."

Find responsibilities that will help you grow and push to get that exposure,Hierarchical and can be muddled by internal politics because of limited resources. Long-term progression often connected with managers who play favorites and know how to get headcount

If I remember correctly, Al Kelly was voted CEO of the year by an industry peer vote.","It's a big company so all the little headaches that come from that, you'll find at Visa.

Most time is spent putting out fires. The organization has been bleeding talent who are leaving for greener pastures.

Work-life balance is basically nonexistant for IT folks. The organization refuses to spend money on new software or hardware, or even new hires. The equipment and software you are forced to use are of very low quality.

I could go on and on, but the company has really deteriorated in terms of corporate culture over the last 3-4 years. They like to prattle on about work life balance, inclusion, etc..., but its nothing more than lip service."

95,Visa Inc.,Strong Feedback Culture/Leadership Can Be Improved,2022-01-15,2.0,"Manager, Client Consulting","Strong feedback culture, interesting client projects with very smart people","VCA leadership attempts to form its own consulting firm identity and culture, but emulates the best in the consulting industry by hiring consultants from MBB, Big 4, and ACN. This results in the same toxic culture that leads to the attrition in the very same firms that those consultants left. Because it’s a young “firm,” none of VCA’s leaders have worked their way up the ranks in the same way that leaders at other firms have. As a result, their expectations are not based on their personal experience at VCA. Some of the leaders were never consultants, but were hired due to their experience at Visa or in payments/financial services. You would imagine that such leaders would bring a breath of fresh air, and help dismantle the poor habits carried over from consulting firms. They’re worse. For example, those leaders have a tendency to under-project the amount of time required to complete client deliverables, forget that people are people, and neglect to build in buffers into their own projects. Projects with such leaders feel like sprinting in a marathon every time even with staff and data science feedback. Those same leaders have work/life balance while their project teams are stressed and burned out by the end of their projects."

There never once was a survey sent out to us asking about our opinions on remote work and flexible hours.

A few teams have amazing people managers.","People managers' skills are extremely lacking in many teams. People are promoted into people managers who have no skills, knowledge, or even an aptitude as managers. Many people managers, including those who have had formal complaints and issues brought forward, are just placed into leadership training classes which check-the-box rather than help.

Overall, company is a pleasant place to work.","I work in HR (People) and it's extremely toxic. Senior leaders have way too much power and very little accountability on how they treat employees. White women in leadership have essentially ran most Black and Brown employees away. Very little room for growth or opportunity if you are a person of color, and/or at the Associate/Analyst level in HR. Visa HR claims to be committed to diversity, but only when it's attached to a hiring metric or what is shown to the public. Sr. Directors and above are not held accountable for their lack of diversity plan to fill internal, leadership roles. Most of the leadership roles go to white women and it's disgusting how they get away with the lack of transparency. 

If you're considering a role in HR, aka People, strongly reconsider your options with other, more INCLUSIVE companies.

I will also say there are some AMAZING teams within Visa and I'm hoping to transfer one day soon. It's so disappointing because I actually LOVE the work I get to do, but my current leadership team is not a good fit for my mental health.

Overall, I would recommend this company to work for but NOT HR/PEOPLE. You will get trampled unless you are a person of privilege or have rank."

2- You can take between 50 to 120 calls a day but if you sit on after call (when you dont put yourself back im ready) for about 2 minutes, managers or supervisor will send you a message to ask why you are not ready to tale calls.

5- even higher mentioned before that we should just be happy to still have a job during the pandemic while someone mentioned our mental health.
6- in the office, you can barely use the restroom. we have to wait for our lunch and breaks because we are only allowed 4 minutes of personal time a day. Can you imagine using the restroom in 4 minutes?

271,Visa Inc.,The most humiliating and disappointing working experience ever!,2021-08-17,1.0,Anonymous Employee,Standard benefits and flexible working during the pandemic.,"Career Development: The worst experience ever. I joined Visa 2 years ago and accepted a more junior position to start with. I believed that good companies would work with me and provided me opportunities to move back up. Contrary to my expectations, they put me in positions to ""fill holes"", which was completely different from what was described during interviews. I was transferred to another team after a year and was able to better utilize some of my skills and experience. Unfortunately, given the change of the company direction, my role changed again - back to the ""filling holes"" mode. Despite I delivered high quality of work and received very positive feedback, I was not given any opportunities to move forward. I had been proactively looking for internal opportunities and I finally found a role that matched my skills, experience, and levels, but I was not allowed to apply as they said the position was 2 levels above me. (That level used to be one level above me and HR added one more level after I joined.) My qualifications, skills, and experience were way beyond the requirements. Even the hiring manager and my manager expressed the role was right for me. Unfortunately, Visa puts policies and rules higher than people. They look at levels far more important than skills, experience, and capabilities in the selection process. If I was not a Visa employee, it was likely for me to at least get an interview. The hierarchical culture was unbelievably strong and rigid at Visa, even more serious than many traditional Asian-rooted firms. I do not think the management has any idea. I feel extremely humiliated and discriminated. I regretted spending more than 2 years in this company and it definitely did more harm than good to my career."

277,Visa Inc.,Meh,2021-07-15,3.0,Senior Project Analyst,"- 401k - I put in 5%, they put in 10%. Really a huge reason most of us stick around. 

- if you have a good boss, which I do, you are in a much better position

- if you want to be better at office politics, you can really learn that here. Good and bad.

- work with a lot of high performers and surprisingly most also have low ego and are happy to teach others

- if you’re young in your career, it looks great on a resume so put in 2-5 years but get out before you get the golden handcuffs with equity they give out. I would highly recommend for a few years but get out before you become very jaded with the intensely high levels of bureaucracy and office politics

- if you are mid-high level in your career and want to sit back and get equity and watch your 401k build and are willing to put up with crazy amounts of politics and red tape (I’m in this bucket) then stay","- Managers have no accountability. If you have a bad one, it doesn’t matter how much visa says it is inclusive or values work life balance. Without that accountability, they can treat you however they want.

- Lack of cohesive strategy within orgs. Everything is bottoms up with no real strategy so in order to get what you need over another org, you have to play a lot of politics

- politics and bias for getting director and above roles. It’s who you know and many people get promoted to these roles who are not good at their jobs or REALLY bad managers (many cases both). A lot of similarity bias since there’s no real pay or promotion structure here which also means you have to mirror your boss to get promoted and leads to lack of female leadership

- lack of any accountability. Some people are amazing and do great work because that’s just who they are, but the bad ones have zero accountability

- to be a sr director or above over a tech org, you have to have an engineering or computer science degree. Doesn’t matter if you have 30 years of coding experience for some reason they care more about what major you picked at 18. This also is a huge systematic bias against women who tend to work in these roles but not have those degrees"

-authoritarian/totalitarian culture. basically the opposite of a flat structure, hierarchical where the only thing that matters is direction from the top. if you are at a lower level, prepare to be cast aside/disrespected by your leadership chain and get the runaround to important things to you and your career
-just lots of sad/unhappy/bitter people. i can't say this type of work fulfills the soul, but if people worked well in teams and developed working relationships it could be better. instead its a bunch of individuals willing to collaborate for their own self interest
-nice guys/gals finish last here. the more you're willing to take in this zero sum game from others (and by definition the less of a team player you are) the more likely you are to be successful here. law of the jungle applies. its not a pleasant place to be.

286,Visa Inc.,A company with poor management that puts their people last. I do not recommend Visa to anyone.,2021-08-03,1.0,Anonymous,"1. 2-to-1 employer match on 401k with immediate vesting
2. Flexible work schedule when returning to the office
3. 4 weeks of remote work per year, manager pending","There are so many cons to Visa that I don't know where to begin. Here are four in no specific order:

1. Terrible leadership. Leaving our CEO, Al Kelly, aside for now, Visa is ripe with terrible leaders that could not care less about their people. In my years at Visa, I've prepared well over one hundred decks for a specific C-suite individual, providing the materials for the vast majority of his presentations. Not once has this individual ever stopped by the team's desk to say hello, not once has he ever stopped by with so much as a thank you. He doesn't appear to have a care in the world for his people or their careers. 

As far as Al (CEO) is concerned, he's a little better but falls far short of me being able to give a thumbs up. In my time at Visa, the most commendable things Al has done are #1 expand the employer contribution of our 401k plan to 2:1 with immediate vesting, and #2 committed to not laying any employees off due to COVID-19 for the remainder of CY 2020. These are commendable, but also not overly gracious given that the 401k match was in response to Trump's tax cut and 2020 was a year of massive fiscal and monetary stimulus to help employers avoid laying people off. At the same time, thousands of employees at Visa have not seen their wages change in two years (2019-2021), despite Visa doing over $10B in share buybacks in that same time. In short, Visa puts its people dead last, oftentimes as a footnote to its shareholders and clients. 

My biggest complaint of Al, however, is that he does so little to intervene in (let alone fix) issues amongst his lieutenants. I believe he knows how bad things things are and how poorly some of his direct reports treat their functions but he doesn't do anything about it. I think part of this is his physical separation living on the East Coast while the vast majority of his employees live in California. He seems detached and I question how involved he is in building a better corporate culture. 

2. Consolidation of power at the top. Visa has a huge problem with consolidation of power at the top, oftentimes amongst men. These select few (Al, Ryan, Vasant, Jack) call most of the shots and they aren't open to other's opinions. If you're looking for a collaborative environment where you can have a voice and drive change, my experience has been you will not find this at Visa. Instead, this is a command-and-control environment.

3. Incredibly poor career progression. This varies by team and function, but many groups have terrible career progression. In my experience, I've seen managers and group heads actively try to block their employees from pursuing new opportunities. What's more, these same leaders will oftentimes engage in frequent nepotism and are not incentivized to help their people's careers. As a result, people's careers are oftentimes stalled out for years with nowhere to go, sometimes with a manager actively showing favorites, sometimes with a manager actively sabotaging his people's career development. 

In this same vein, there is little correlation between performance and career development. Visa does little to reward or promote top performers. Your best shot at seeing career progression may well be the person in front of you leaving the company for another opportunity.

4. A lack of positive corporate culture. In short, items #1-3 drive a poor corporate culture. Relative to other companies in the Bay, Visa's corporate culture is extremely lacking. Many things feels like lip service with no heart behind them."

-The company is plagued by an epidemic of horrible managers with no mediation from HR.  Unethical and unprofessional conduct is commonplace at the VP level coupled with a well-founded fear of retribution among their staff.
-If you value your professional growth, are excited about working in the payments sector and want to work with bright, sociable colleagues- avoid Visa at all costs.  You will eventually feel stifled by the pervasive lack of innovation and the culture of passive aggression.
-Teams are extremely silo'd and uncommunicative with cohorts.  You may find people unwilling to share best practices or even coach/train one another because of fear that you might do things better.

415,Visa Inc.,Only come if you want to get exposure as a new grad on the workforce or you plan on retiring,2021-04-19,1.0,Software Engineer,Interesting concepts can sometimes come up.,"- Work life balance is bad.
- Finger-pointing is second nature to most people
- Management has a lot of power especially the people that have been there for 10 plus years. They can basically do what they want regardless of what their managers say.
- Lot of times they try to reinvent the wheel but add 10000x more complexity because they want to be fully security compliant out the door. There isn't an idea of an MVP (Minimal Viable Product)
- Zero mentorship it is a very ""they will throw you in the deep end"" mentality because time and effort is not valued into growing talent.
-- This really speaks to the type of people that are there. You either have fresh new grad or you have people that have been working in industry for 10 plus years
-- There is a very ""I am busy you need to figure out type of attitude""
-- Planning is not done well and job functions have a very fuzzy line in terms of what you should be doing.
-- Compensation is at the lowest end of the spectrum
-- ESPP plan is complete garbage and just a cheap way to give employees some stock incentives as they cancelled their pension plan a lot time ago.
- Anything you ask HR about outreach or something they can't link you to and read a reference is a black hole and you will never hear about it again."

No change or reaction from management when employees state that their workload is unmanageable and their overall well being is being impacted.

440,Visa Inc.,"A soul sucking, stressful, bureaucratic, nightmare (literally)",2021-03-17,1.0,Senior Software Engineer,"- work on some high scale systems
- decent pay and great benefits
- CEO is good","- the bureaucracy is very bad, you have to talk to so many ppl for every little thing

- tech stack is cumbersome, dev env(s) down a lot, tons of manual steps, tooling is slow and painful. Devs don't get much time to build much tooling to make their lives, or their QA lives easier. 

-processes are very complex, manual, and poorly documented

- developer velocity is very slow

- code quality is a joke most of the time. Things tend to get shoved together because of a deadline coming up. Frameworks get used incorrectly. Then things get re-written since they become an unmaintainable nightmare and the process repeats. 

- some management initiatives are a net loss (i.e. required code coverage, absolutely NO rollbacks). 

- have to enter every hour you spend on every project into tracking system (rally) which ""is not used for performance"" but feels like it is. Then use another tracking system to track the code changes (jira), and possibly other tracking systems (wiki/teams). It is an unorganized mess.

- wiki is slow and search is very bad. Finding accurate information is difficult.

- tons of gatekeepers and ""onboarding"" processes for integrating with other teams. These processes SUCK, when new infra is built, it is not built in a way to be easy to integrate (i.e. lots of meetings and manual steps).

- release process is terrible. Use of wikis to keep track of release information and release instructions. The process is not automated, not consistent. Some of the releases have jenkins jobs but even then you need to add your instructions on how to trigger the job for ever release, and a guy in ops must do the release, teams can't release without ops involvement. Releases take a long time and are error prone. It takes DAYs to prepare for a release, and must involve several people.

- case in point with release process - it once took 3 months to get out a trivial bug fix, that customers were running into (there was a work around, but still, a bad experience), simply because the release process was so terrible and we have ""code freezes"" . The change was fixed for months in lower env but kept getting de prioritized due to the work required to do the release!!! 

- since releases are so difficult rollbacks are expensive, there is a lot of pressure to get it right, which means development moves slow. Also, upper management (ie 3 levels above my boss) crap on me and my boss if you do end up making a mistake which requires a rollback. Stressful! Sometimes I wouldn't be able to sleep at night because I was worried about a release going bad!

- since there is so much pressure to get releases right, and it is so difficult, lots of changes end up getting bunched together, decreasing velocity, increasing coordination, and increasing risk. 

- gatekeeping by humans in testing environments! You have access to do stuff in dev, but in qa, signoff (pre-pre prod), SIT (dev integration), and cas(pre-prod) you don't have control and you have to make a bunch of jira tickets to get something done, then you need to ping the person assigned to the ticket to work on it cause they are super busy with other stuff..... Should be automated!!!

- Bangalore collaboration is a pain (I worked in US office). Some work like perf testing or tightly coupled dev work is done by counterpart team in Bangalore. This means you need to stay up anywhere from 8pm-12am to work with them, while they also have to wake up early or stay work late in order to meet with you (timezone is ~10-12 hr diff). I have even seen some engineers from Bangalore staying until 2AM (their time) just to meet with our team here in USA (how is that ok for non emergency??)! What doesn't get done in person must get done over email, so it slows the process even more. The Bangalore teams have excellent engineers, but the time difference makes high collaboration work stressful! 

- lots of penny pinching for projects. I guess it is somewhat normal since companies can't just spend money on whatever, but getting a project funded is loooong and painful process.

- so many approvals, including getting rubber stamps from architects that are very disconnected from your projects, it seems to rarely catch problems or enhance the designs (in my experience), and ends up being a big time waster.

- a bunch of TOI (transfer of information) sessions. Rather than having everything clearly documented and easy to find you need to schedule a meeting with someone to learn how stuff works, almost on a daily basis. This takes a lot of time."

Good coworkers - although low on morale. 
Sometimes free food and cool events. 
Decent WLB.
Nice office layout and environment
Some projects are interesting","Reorgs happen way too often resulting in strategy changes every year or sooner.

I've seen a VP yell at my coworker in front of me many times. Often blaming him for not doing something when it wasn't even a priority. My own manager has yelled at me as well in front of coworkers. Is that really appropriate? Is this good management?

There's a major communication gap between VPs and what they really want versus what we're working on. Typically the VPs barely know what product we're working on. They're only concerned with their personal projects. 

Raises and promotions are almost impossible if you don't get to work closely with the VP on their projects. We'll see the same folks being promoted.

One VP even wanted his group to donate to a company he's on the board of. Super awkward.

For most folks, this is not the place to grow your career."

Hiring process is a joke but there are teams that are understaffed so they rely heavily on overseas contractors. Lots of internal sites/dashboards that are poorly designed/engineered, everything looks like it was made by contractors who spent their tenure looking for full-time employment.

Engineers don't work like that, management does. Unfortunately the leadership thinks otherwise. Peer feedbacks are used against you so you get a lower rating, irrespective of the work you deliver. It's the engineer's responsibility to find opportunities and then step on it to move forward while the management just sits back and applauds whoever can pull it off.

There are some very amazing people with smarts and outstanding experiences. Working along side of them is gratifying.

The pay and benefits are exceptional and competitive with other companies in the Bay Area.","Visa used to be a fun place to work. It was very collegial. But sadly, that has been lost. It is now a hyper-competitive, bureaucratic ""meritocracy"". You are graded on a curve. Only a small handful of people can be highly rated. If you are not highly rated then you do not get a very good bonus and possibly no stock awards. The review system is based on your popularity among your peers who provide feedback, and that is used against you if you are not popular; regardless of what you factually delivered to the company. The feedback is completely subjective and based on personal opinions. Different managers use different criteria. Some managers collect the feedback and keep it secret from the employee. Other managers tell their people to collect the feedback themselves and then share it with their manager. Obviously the quality of the feedback is going to be different when it is anonymous. Some managers even follow up with a more probing investigation to gather more negative ""improvement opportunities"". There is no standardized set of criteria used and there is no consistent way of rating people's individual performance on the criteria across the company. It is all totally subjective. When review time comes around, morale drops because people do not like being unfairly judged and know they have little ability to get an above average review unless they win the congeniality award or the big boss likes them."

Security SDLC has just been merged with product teams for instance, new SAST tools, new processes (DevOps for all PD teams), performance based bonuses. Many opportunities for training. Fun normal people to work with (ie they have families and lives). Hires come traditional from excellent schools and background. Company culture. Does not tolerate sexual harassment. Constantly improved","Commuting to Foster City is a huge pain. There is a suspicion that the FC campus is going to be closed. Getting more cutthroat, partly due to non-US Asian, US and non-US Indian influx. Management is hit or miss, unstable at times, and much resentment lingers over freezing of defined pension plan. Many old timers left with invaluable longitudinal domain knowledge without proper debrief, being replaced by cheaper new tech savvy go-gethers w/o same commitment to the company. Some minorities and dietary restrictions are not tended to in the cafeterias.  MC seems to be further along tech wise for a while now. Very poor time management partly due to poor tech nudges (ie meeting windows only in 30 minute increments by default).

2. Low-skilled engineers: In Visa there are many very low-skilled senior engineers. They does not basic software development skills, but they still get good review and promoted.
3. Lack of diversity: Too many engineers from India, probably 70-80%. Some teams are pure Indian engineers, even it's in Austin. Indian hires Indian, Indian promotes Indian.

The pay was good, bonuses fantastic, and stock incentive very generous.  The overall environment was one that invested heavily into employee satisfaction and product innovation.","Recently, with recent management changes (CEO and virtually all direct reports and virtually the entire 2nd layer) has resulted in less of a technology-focused culture.  Nearly all senior managers are from JP Morgan or Mckinsey and as a result, the management focus has shifted from serving customers, employees and innovating in the marketplace to a culture of pinching pennies and cutting costs (at the expense of customers and employees).  While the company is still financially strong, this short-sightedness will hurt the company in the long term.  The entire management team is now comprised of leaders with less than a year of experience, and frankly, they do not understand the products and business culture of the company.  It is sad to see, but I will not be surprised if Visa goes through some tough times in the near future.  HR is a disaster-  There has been nothing but poorly executed and botched benefit, payroll, and HRIS changes."

Want to learn another part of the business? Good luck! Internal knowledge and transferable skills are less valued than direct position experience. Because of this, departments continue to work in silos and when things break it becomes finger pointing time. Having someone with the knowledge of other teams would go a long way to fixing the broken processes."
