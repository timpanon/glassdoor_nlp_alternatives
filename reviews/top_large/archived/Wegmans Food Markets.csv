1,Wegmans Food Markets,"Hard work for okay/low pay, but an overall good environment",2022-02-03,5.0,Prep Cook/Line Cook,"Very positive, supportive environment, good employee amenities, clean environment, handled covid better than other places. The people were great, can't think of a single person who I would actively try to avoid. The chefs were hard working and did attempt to take care of their people.","Hurt by the labor situation like everywhere else, few people doing the jobs of many. When I started the pay for part timers was very low. Started at like 10.50, but they reworked their part time wages the summer before I had to leave to around $15, which was okay. Part timers did not get any real holiday or Sunday pay, where full timers would make time and a half, part timers would get an extra dollar/hour which never felt worth it in comparison. The downside is the full timers had no control over their schedules, and would find themselves in rough Close/Opens or being moved to old departments that they had tried to leave if manning needed. Sushi department specifically had incredibly high turnover."
2,Wegmans Food Markets,Decent stepping stone,2022-02-21,3.0,Facilities Technician,The pay is decent for the work that you do and there are opportunities for advancement. Your happiness at work all depends on your manager honestly. Sometimes I am asked to do ridiculously stupid things and then sometimes I get great opportunities to learn valuable technical skills but you need to be self-motivated and seek out opportunities if you want to learn. If management likes you then you have good opportunities to climb the ladder but it all takes time. If management does not like you then they will give you a lot of false promises and never fulfill their end of the deal.,I have a manager who asked me to do a lot of other peoples jobs. It gets very frustrating when you are trying to focus on what you need to do. In my personal experience the only way to learn technical aspects of the role are to work with contractors instead of in-house. The pay is all right for what you do but should be more. You have to work weekends and have and open availability. The company used to be a lot better to work for as they closely followed their core values but nowadays it seems more so about making as much money as possible without consideration for the employees. Everybody is getting worn very thin and management does not make many accommodations but that may also be because we are shortstaffed.
3,Wegmans Food Markets,AMAZING,2022-04-01,5.0,Pharmacy Technician,"I honestly love the company, I love my job, I have nothing bad to say.

18,Wegmans Food Markets,Feels like working with a family,2022-03-07,5.0,Front End Cashier,"The managers are kind, supportive and can handle most if not all kinds of customers.

20,Wegmans Food Markets,Look elsewhere,2022-01-27,2.0,Management,"great health insurance 
raises 2x per year 
some really amazing people work there and you can make friends easily","everyone in management is out for themselves 
although great people work there, the horrible people far outnumber the good 
almost everyone is management are awful people with horrible double standards 
near impossible to get a job in upper management unless a new store opens or you suck up to EVERYONE above you and work ridiculous hours beyond the scope of your job
work life balance does not exist at this company
almost everything positive they tell you about the company culture and benefits of working for wegmans is a complete lie 
favoritism is rampant and so are cliques 
most likely you will be managed by someone who has never actually worked in your position, they will have unrealistic expectations and chastise you for not getting something done even if it was on a day you were off or during requested vacation time"
21,Wegmans Food Markets,Terrible. From Corporate to In-Store.,2022-03-29,1.0,Retail Sales Associate,"Weekly pay
Co-workers were a pleasure to work with.
 Team Leaders were dependable and supportive","Cashiering was terrible. They treat you like a decent human being for the first three weeks you start out. Then, you're ignored and left at the (lack of) mercy of rude customers and even ruder third party employees (Instacart). Five star pandering to the screaming customer who felt like the cashier wasn't bagging their 200-500 item haul fast enough. Upper management was too lazy to enforce the limit of how many people can enter the store during peak COVID months. No support unless you were favored. I was left to rot on the register for hours with no break and mostly had lunch late. 

Team leaders had the responsibilities of managers; sadly they were not paid enough for it. Upper management continued to excel at doing absolutely nothing when it came to addressing employee concerns (hiring more people, high stress environment). With the high amounts of traffic from Instacarters placing their shopping carts everywhere and customer lines blocking the doors weekends have become a nightmare to walk into. Every week or two the freezers would break or stop working and it would take twice as long to get them fixed. Daily pallet loads are too much for two-three people to handle consistently. Upper management would 'grace us with their presence' when the help isn't needed; so their concern is performative at best. Unnecessary criticism is infuriating. Its not helpful to hear that we spent too much time on the pallets in the day when at max 3 people is there to handle 4-5 pallet loads. Too much showboating from upper management and not enough actual work. 

Corporate visits are an extreme hinderance and serve absolutely no point. Every time corporate visits and etc visit daily production is at a standstill. It becomes more about maintaining the aesthetic of a well run store when it was in fact far from the truth. Then there was having to stand in line, waiting for them to pass so we can greet them as if it was parade watching at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. As if day stocking didn't exist. And the managers are even more annoying to deal with because they want it to go so smoothly. This was frequent too. 

The company's rushed efforts of overambition just to have a store in NYC took a toll on the employees."

Some good managers, shift leads, care about the customer experience (pro/con)","No raises for part-time workers; no incentives during COVID; no discount on our own groceries like Giant, Whole Food, Trader Joes, Safeway, etc; as much as they say it's a family, it's more like Putin, they are the authoritarian, receive all the money and the employees receive scraps; again no raises for part-time staff apparently; most frustrating as a cashier - Wegman's has it's own products, as a grocery chain you would think they would create packaging that would be not just beneficial for the consumer but for their employees. Barcodes blocked by seams, plastic chicken containers that could cut your finger, and do mess up a long of bags, come on, you can do better! Finally, bias - as a cashier working the front of the store, there are a multitude of different jobs you can do during your shift, cashiering, self-check, cart-to-curve; restock items left by customers. Every shift I work, those areas are provided to favorites. I'm a great worker, have asked time and time again to try new areas, but it always goes to the younger people, the same people. I signed up to work as a cashier in the front of the house, that includes all the other areas I mentioned, where is my opportunity. I have asked several times, even a store manager said they would make it happen, never happened. Now I'm thinking about leaving in May as it does get monotonous doing the same job every shift for 9 months."

Scholarship for people in college is really nice","After a while if you’re a overachiever they take advantage of you, questioning why you’re taking time off, I would get texts from my manager almost every week literally *begging* me to come in on my one day off, when I told her multiple times I had drs appointments on that day, but she didn’t care and continued to do it right up until I decided to part with the company. made me feel super guilty and uncomfortable in the workplace 

Managers are just thrown around in positions sometimes that they should not be in and makes the department hectic due to lack of leadership 

In the situation mentioned above often times a long term PT or FT employee of that department will have to almost take over the role of manager without the pay, and yes this happened with PT people too 

Very fake and toxic positivity, everyone was just so fake nice it was sickening sometimes.

Would force you to follow corporate policy but then if there was a huge issue with a customer management would just side with the customer making us look bad, because we have to follow the rules but they don’t ?? Not very empowering to me."

269,Wegmans Food Markets,Avoid at all costs,2021-07-09,1.0,Warehouse Selector,Absolutely no pros to this job environment other than full time employment and decent benefits.,"Where to begin....

1. Say goodbye to everyone and everything. You start off catered to, no overtime, all your days off, and staying in your department. However once your 3 months are over expect 10-12h days and 6 days a week. Management doesn't care you've busted your butt for 6 straight days for 1 day off they demand AND expect 100% every day while they'll sit on their butts and pretend to know what we do. 

2. Oh it's a super light day for your particular department? Not for you. They'll send every senior man home and still expect work to be done on time. And if that's not enough you'll be sent out and forced at a different department making that light day, and all possible plans, nonexistent

3. You want to do something on your day off? Good luck, not only can you not request your days off, but you're expected to work OT on them. You get 1 day off so better hope no doctor appointments, dental, relative need anything until then 

4. You have a union but they're a joke. They'll stand next to you when you're being scolded by your department manager and not say anything to help you. But if you go over their heads to report a senior man expect to be yelled at. 

5. They can't even pay you high enough starting pay to be worth it. $16.50?? McDonald's employees make $15 at way less stress. Sure OT ""boosts"" your pay but 60h/w isn't worth it.



Just stay away at all costs."

Ever since Covid began the company has made decision after decision that have made our jobs extremely stressful. Very few people are happy to work here anymore. Short staffed departments are being cut even further by replacing full time with part time employees creating an endless cycle of interviewing, hiring, and training because once they realize how much work there is to do for such little pay they’re out the door. Despite low staffing departments are expected to do even more than we were doing pre-Covid when we had less workload and more staff. Upper store management doesn’t care about employees personal lives and expects them to put their job above everything else in their life. Upper store management allows many employees to get away with doing little to no work throughout the day while beating down hard workers and expecting them to take on more and more responsibility. They’re combining and downsizing departments and forcing employees into positions they have no interest in. Morale is incredibly low and will continue to drop the longer this goes on."

They frequently are inflexible and will place blame on subordinates for any issues.
Hour squeeze - there's word that higher level management have incentives to cut hours. I don't know if that's true. Wegmans policy is that workers are entitled to their scheduled hours. Service Team Leaders frequently call departments asking how much work needs to be done, and how much time is *really* needed to do it.

Also, and I'm only adding this because I'm asked to rate this company on ""diversity and inclusion"" in the next section of this review, my location almost never hired black applicants to customer facing roles (unless they fit a specific 'inoffensive' profile). It was blatantly obvious that they were willing to hamper the advancement of certain employees to ensure that the yokels of Harford county MD wouldn't have to interact with anyone with more than a few molecules of melanin.

No static days off or rotating weekends. This can make work life balance difficult.
Confusing and not transparent posting and promotion process that has ""feed back"" that is often vague and hard to nail down. The process has all the feels of a system to mask favoritism rather than prevent it. Seemingly always behind the technology curve on almost everything.

No communication, no inclusion. They have suddenly cut staff to increase profits but no one has told us why, or what the plan is. The cuts are drastic and our jobs are impossible to do well. Inevitably, the quality has gone down, a lot of product is missing because we can’t get it out to customers, employee injuries are way up, and employee satisfaction and retention are at a crisis point. Customer complaints are way up. Our Dept Managers are great but store leadership is disengaged. This breaks our hearts because we loved this store. We’re working ourselves to death but can’t possibly get our jobs done. Leadership throws out the occasional ( phony) ‘thank you for all you’re hard work’ then tells our managers to make us work harder. The strategy isn’t working. Customers aren’t happy, employees aren’t happy. I can’t recommend anyone apply to this store until something changes."

562,Wegmans Food Markets,Lack of transparency on pay,2021-09-14,1.0,Manager,Quick to get a response to my application,"Disrespectful hiring process. They expect you to interview multiple times, but refuse to give you even a range of pay. They repeat that you will find out pay if you get an offer.

I'm sorry, but this is very disrespectful. Knowing what a job is going to pay before being asked to jump through hoops and prove my worth is the bare minimum. Am I trying to prove that I'm worth minimum wage, $25/hr, $30/hr? I should know, and you should be able to tell your candidates during an interview what you are going to pay them.

The only reason to not clearly advertise your pay is because you are paying inequitably, and people are all getting different rates of pay for the same job. On that note. you have 4 different management positions listed for your new store. I asked the interviewer what the difference is, and she told me they are all the exact same thing. So is this just another way for you to pay people different rates for the same job, different titles? Also, what is up with not paying managers a salary? Who works in management for an hourly wage? And you're hiring 40 managers for one store? Because none of them are receiving full-time benefits.After this experience, I will no longer do my shopping at Wegmans; I don't care how pretty your rack of lamb are. I feel so disrespected by this hiring process that I could never give this company my business again.

All around dishonest hiring practices. I am upset that I wasted my time applying for a company that does not value people and lacks transparency. Just a tip to anyone working for them: ask your coworkers what they make! I think you are all going to find that you are being paid very different rates from one another. Organize, unionize!"

578,Wegmans Food Markets,Very good company,2021-10-30,4.0,Customer Service,Very good quality environment. Good friendship,"Low salary, It is hard for you to pass full time position"
579,Wegmans Food Markets,Be Careful,2021-07-26,3.0,Food Service Worker,"Wegmans will hire you initially part-time so they can determine whether you are worthy to move up to full-time (if that is what you want). I seemed to have caused disarray among management when I asked (during the interview) to work no more than X hours per week despite having a wide-open available schedule. Once hired, I was scheduled 30-35 hours/wk (much more than I wanted), working 6-7 days in a row (54 hours in a 7 day time period over two pay periods). I did not complain. My schedule was better when I was a full-time employee elsewhere. Scheduling someone ~35 hours/wk gives Wegmans the benefit of having an almost full-time employee without having to provide full-time benefits. Disgruntled, several weeks later, I found another part-time job elsewhere, was ready to leave, but they insisted I stay and agreed to an even more limited part-time work schedule than originally requested. So, if you prove your value to them, they will be accommodating to your needs, but they seemed to have ignored by initial request for limited hours. Besides this experience, I have no other complaints about management; they are approachable and will help you out with any questions you might have. The department and perishable (boss of the department) managers will provide you guidance and input. Diverse, friendly and helpful co-workers are everywhere. Ample opportunities to cross-train in other areas and they advertise promotion opportunities in-house before they seek candidates externally.","Flexible scheduling is promoted as a great benefit, but I am not sure why. You are required to give two weeks notice if you want time off (like all jobs?) and must verbally talk to your boss (no emails or phone messages) if you can't make it in to work for a particular day due to illness, emergencies, etc. I guess they are saying that if you need the time off and you follow these rules, your request should be accepted because there are so many other employees in your department who can cover for you. I don't get it. $14.50 per hour could be higher for my job; I see now that Costcos and Whole Foods pays more ($15-16/hr). In retrospective, I believe I could have counter-offered for a higher hourly salary."

588,Wegmans Food Markets,Used to be a good company,2020-11-21,3.0,Customer Service Representative,"Flexible with time off, managers are friendly","Part timers don't get benefits, working under some managers who don't follow guidelines to do their jobs correctly (and upper management knows this), the men in upper management definitely always vouch for each other even when someone is in the wrong. 

In the past I have given my availability and they severely cut my hours leaving me to have to ask managers myself for more hours weekly...Most employees are severely underpaid. Employees who started 10 years ago with the company are only making a couple dollars more per hour than cashiers who just recently started with the company.

They want you to be flexible and cross-train through different departments to give you more opportunities and hours, but you never truly reap the benefits and definitely do not get compensated for your flexibility and willingness to learn more in attempt to move up. 

Throughout 2020 they constantly told us not to post online about the company regarding controversies that happened in the city store locations with BLM protestors and cops. They would also never give us clear answers about what really went down. They knew that we knew that one location had protestors arrested for being in one of the store plazas and they did their best to just not acknowledge it. 

I have heard from many people that this company used to be way more family friendly before Robert Wegman passed. Now, all they care about is money and expanding the company to different states across the country. It's sad."

Listening and hearing other employees issues about the company and hopefully trying to deliver the feedback to hierarchy.","Where do I start? Restaurant foods area is highly unstable and toxic for the day to day employee that is trying to accomplish their job. Things I've noticed: the executive chef doesn't seem to hold himself nor his kitchen to a high standard. When an issue is brought to him, he chooses to point fingers with his team of immature sous chefs. Their have been so many issues with either undercooked food or not being able to produce on time that the responsibilities and retaliation fall down on the employees working there. This is just from an observation that I've witnessed. When it comes to any forms of harassment in the workplace the executive chef and his sous chefs who are considered managers brush it off as if it never happened and go about their business whatever that may be. I've witnessed so much within this company ranging from information in HR complaints that are suppose to be confidential somehow no longer confidential. To employees being verbally or sexually harassed with minor consequences. Another thing I notice is whenever the executive chef is off, the sous chefs find it as a day off for them to not do any work at all and avoid employee concerns at all cost."

My manager didn't want to be there anymore, but they wouldn't let her leave. So she threw her team leaders under the bus constantly. There was so much undermining, scapegoating, and gaslighting from the start that it seriously impacted my mental health and personal life, which was nearly non-existent by the end of my time there. It became impossible to manage my own developing depression, my boyfriend's coincidentally failing health and disability, and the stresses of working in such a toxic environment. I would go to work, work late because nothing went right, try to make a quick dinner or just skip meals, check in with my boyfriend who needed much more support than I was giving, and then hopefully get 5-6 hours of sleep at best.

755,Wegmans Food Markets,They Don't Always Give You Their Best,2021-05-14,2.0,Produce Team Leader,"Free coffee, about once a month they do an employee appreciation lunch, more than competitive pay (time and a half on Sundays for full-time employees), emphasis on quality products, fair scheduling practices if you are a regular team member, will hold your job for you if you have a medical excuse which keeps you out for months at a time.","You don't want to be promoted above team member. Management/supervisory positions are required to have 24/7 availability. Scheduling practices are haphazard (many times, I was scheduled to work until 10PM at night and then required to come in at 5AM the next morning). CONSTANT and UNNECESSARY pressure from the area managers. Constantly understaffed. But most of all, the company only cares about their status as ""one of the best places to work at"", and will do ANYTHING to keep that title - so the HR department has created an atmosphere of complete forgiveness for what would normally be a reason to fire someone. Come in 15 minutes late every day? No problem. Call out once or twice a week? Sure! Work at a snail's pace just to get through the day? That's OK too. As a result, the supervisory and managerial staff end up putting in ridiculous hours (like 60 hours a week), and then get berated by store management for putting in so many hours! The HR department doesn't seem to do anything for anyone, and walk around the store all day with coffee in their hands telling everyone to have a great day. Also, their warehouse is ridiculously incompetent - pallets packed poorly so that they fall apart in the delivery truck, or worse yet, fall down on employees. Constant damage to stock due to poor handling by the warehouse workers. Sometimes pallets from a delivery are missing or, worse yet, loaded on the wrong truck and delivered to the wrong store. Another con is their ordering system, called CAO (Computer Assisted Ordering). It doesn't take into account any individual store sales, or holidays that don't fall on the same day every year (such as Thanksgiving - one of the busiest times of the year). Yet the CAO liaison for Wegmans is constantly coming down on department managers for doing too many order edits! Even though it's a family-owned company, they're getting too big for their britches, and more and more, the corporate elite is out of touch with what's actually happening in the stores."

If you're lucky you'll get a manager who is actually decent.(In all my years in the company I met 4 managers and the best managers who actually followed the core values of the company--care, respect, empower the employees, etc have actually quit the company or moved to different stores/markets.)
Health insurance is quite good and that is why you'll see many people of older age. 
Free anti-slippery working shoes twice a year.","Your skills and knowledge are undervalued. Your resume is actually never even looked at because they have their own qualifications.  The wrong people are hired for the job. The wrong people are promoted. If you are lazy and don't mind putting on a smile and show up to pick up your check this is the place for you. If you are skilled, a hard working fella and passionate about your job, you will waste your time working there--there's no manager capable of seeing it and rewarding you. People in higher ranks were getting paid less than lower ranks. 
You won't be appreciated enough despite the ''employee appreciation days'' they throw once or twice a year. 
You Will pick up the slack of the lazy people and burn out and get paid the same or even less.
The reason for good health insurance is because of the high volume there is many injuries. So many there's a board counting them over the week."

1549,Wegmans Food Markets,DONT DO IT,2020-08-13,2.0,Overnight Cashier,You can just shop when you finish your shift. You never have to make a special trip to the grocery store.,"Schedule is crazy. If you're full time they expect you to be available every day of the week, and they guilt trip you into not asking for any regular days off. They dont make any effort to put your 2 days off next to eachother, even if you work overnight.

The customers treat you like garbage and managers blatantly disregard safety policies.

Theres a rotating door of managers. I would be told by one ""we're going to get you a coordinator position!"" Only for that manager to get transfered and I would have to prove myself to *another* one right away.

Dont expect to move up unless you're very physically attactive, know someone in corporate, or are somehow marginalized (disabled, minority, lgbtq). Merrit is basically worthless.

I left this job for a real career and have been promoted every year and a half ever since, on merrit alone. I had bosses at wegmans who cried because they couldnt access their email, and others who slept through their opening shift so I had to stay late into the morning to run the front end for them.

They once fired a woman I worked with for requesting time off to go to school, which is something they normally allow. She was a star employee - far better at what we did than me or anyone else in our department. They had the nerve to tell her she could reapply in 6 months if she finished out her schedule. She had 2 kids, so she had to choke back the tears and do her best to serve customers. My department had to threaten a walk out to get her her job back. She's with a better company now.

They dont care about you. They will work you to death. This company single habdedly made me lose faith in humanity. Run far far away."

1670,Wegmans Food Markets,"Decent Company, unless you're disabled.",2020-05-16,4.0,Front End Cashier,"1.The people I worked with were mostly nice or at least tolerable.
2.The pay is okay some places pay more but you get two (small) raises per year and they pay every week.
3.Its fairly easy to get small amounts (one or two days) of time off as long as you let them know a week or two ahead of time.
4.Switching departments is easy if you don't have medical disabilities or need medical accommodations.(See cons for more info.)
5.They try to make accommodations for physical disabilities. (See cons for any other disabilities and minor/nonvisible physical disabilities)
6.Management generally takes the employee's side when angry customers try to cause a scene. (Provided that it was the customer that escalated the event and you don't have a track record of causing problems)
7. Their Coronavirus/Covid19 response prioritized the health and safety of employees and they began implementing safety measures as early as the first week of March.","1.The customers are often very self entitled and it is very taxing trying to serve them especially if there is any actual issue.
2.If you have medical disabilities that they don't already have a policy for they will make it difficult for you to get long term accommodations and will actively punish you if the accommodations are inconvenient for the company.
3. If you need to get accommodations for a disability they will not let you change departments if you will also need accommodations in that department. (This effectively makes it so you cannot advance in the company with the exception of a handful of jobs that you are less likely to get because you cannot train in multiple departments.)
4. They say that they offer health insurance for part-time employees but in truth you can only qualify if you work a certain amount of hours per week and rarely do they actually give anyone enough hours to qualify. It's not even that great insurance either."

Loved my co-workers, and the job is actually okay. You always have something to do and there's never a slow moment. There are opportunities to move to other departments if the one you're in doesn't suit you.","Have had situations where the head chefs tried to call me in on a day off or on vacation days. Lots of talk about how the kitchen is ""a family"" which translates into ""we ask you to stay on longer than you should, and we won't pay you benefits or overtime for it"".

1776,Wegmans Food Markets,Not Good for Professional Growth,2020-02-23,2.0,Front End Coordinator,"-I've found that the majority of coworkers are extremely friendly, and I have personally made some lasting friendships with the people who work there.
-Somewhat flexible scheduling","-I was hired at almost the Federal minimum wage (7.50/hour) and since then they're rate at hire has been increased. However, after six years I was making almost the same as new hires in a lower position (even with the 25 cent raise every six months) because the pay of long-time employees was not adjusted. When other employees brought these concerns to the attention of HR and the area managers, the complaints were largely ignored. Not a good company to work for if you want a good and fair pay. 
-The company is expanding the services offered to increase convenience for customers such as Instacart and Wegmans2Go with curbside delivery and in-store grocery pick-up. However, these increased responsibilities were passed on to the Front End Coordinating team I was a part of without adjustments to the schedule or the addition of employees. We were now expected to do our previous duties in addition to these services in other areas of the store. This lack of forethought by the store and company to hire more people or adjust the expectations of my position because of the added work made for a very stressful work environment and added daily confusion and communication issues.
-The problem with this company that has effected me the most personally is their policy on references and recommendations. The company has a policy that NO recommendations or references are ever allowed, and HR can only verify the dates of employment. As a graduating college student who has been employed at Wegmans since the age of 15 with no prior work experience, this was extremely detrimental to my pursuit for a career in my field of study. When attempting to get an internship with the Federal Government, it was REQUIRED that an Employment Reference form was filled out, which included questions about my personal work ethic. Wegmans refused to answer these questions even when contacted by an investigator working for the Federal government. As someone who has worked at this company for over six years now and has never had any problems with management, this really showed how the company values you as a person. This company really does not care for employees personal and professional development. Definitely DO NOT recommend this company for anyone in high school or college looking to improve their professional experience and increase their network.
-Inconsistent scheduling for both part-time and full-time employees outside of the store managers. 
-I worked at the Customer Service desk for two years and although this is not the fault of the company itself, the way customers treat you so negatively everyday really effects your work and personal life. I would not recommend this position for anyone looking to be happy at work.
-I've witnessed the way management regards the Cashiers and Helping Hands (parking lot attendants) as if they have the ""easy job"" when these are the two most thankless and frustrating positions in the store. 
-Weekend are difficult to actually have off because Wegmans strives to never have more employees then they think they need: even though management will never be there most weekends of the month. 
-If you dislike hypocritical leadership and being seen only as an employee and not a person, this is not the company for you."
1777,Wegmans Food Markets,"""family environment""",2020-08-26,2.0,Customer Service,Time and a half on Sundays for full-time employment,They don't care about you at this store at all.
1778,Wegmans Food Markets,Wegmans is Great if You Don't Like Healthcare or Making Rent,2020-02-29,3.0,Cook III,"Working in the Wegmans kitchen is a great way to see if you'd be interested in a more ""restaurant-like"" environment.  It's not quite as fast-paced, but I'd say it's a great start for someone unsure of whether or not they could handle/would enjoy working line.","Despite the agenda they try to push, moving up in the company is incredibly difficult.   I was there for 3 years and applied for multiple promotions only to get told that I didn't qualify because I would've had to work a different (additional) position prior.  The storefront I worked at, located in Virginia,  also didn't pay me a living wage or give me enough part-time hours to qualify for benefits.  After talking to other previous and current employees, this doesn't look like a unique experience.   Because their model for promotions requires managers to move up before allowing lower-level and part-time staff to vie for full-time positions.  We had one woman who was part of our server staff who had to wait five years before she was considered for a full-time job, and during that time she had no access to healthcare nor did her family.  Ultimately, Wegmans doesn't have a business model that works for lower-level employees.  I can only recommend working for them if you either a) plan on making a life long career of it (I would've had to work for the company for six years in order to afford a one-bedroom apartment in this area) or b) are in school, living with your parents rent-free, and just trying to gain some experience in the service industry."

1812,Wegmans Food Markets,Helping hands/Cashier,2020-02-15,4.0,Cashier,Was trained for both Cashier front end and Helping hands AKA Outside help/Cart pushing. Offer a 60 cent raise every 6 months but its mostly to combat inflation and keep the pay competitive. Outside is hard and few in the store can do it but once you get used to it the day flys by quickly and you don't have to stand around all day like being a cashier. They offer free soup and water bottles for helping hands and often give wegmans brand Gaterade during the summer.  Management sees at least what 'I' do and praise when I do a good job leaving me with more freedom and less micro management.,"Nobody is your friend, technically. Everyone is out for themselves, while 'anyone' can move up. People who already know each other outside of work be it family or friends will always choose them for promotion over you no matter how hard you work as they attempt to ignore it or reward you in other ways, but asking is always key ALWAYS ask, everyday if you have to. Co-workers watch what kind of worker you are either you talk too little or too much can get you moved around or denied slower shifts and moved to busier ones to 'avoid' the chatter boxes chatting too much, worse case denied transfers and promotions.

Many people only work the minimum. The tend I a have been seeing with Former and Current employees posting about Wegmans is that you have some that are expected to run the entire store and others do the boot licking minimum, this causes people to quit as the unfair workloads start to really bother people especially in more labor intensive divisions.

Lastly people call out all the time, I guess this is a double edged sword but unless you are full-time. Wegmans can't fire you for calling out unless you don't show up for the job for multiple days and even then that is if you can even afford to, its mostly kids however that do this."

They would take advantage of us like this for several months at a time before finally dishing out the extra $3/hr for your promotion."

1907,Wegmans Food Markets,"Okay, but could be better",2019-10-02,3.0,Front End Cashier,"The flexibility was great. They were okay if I had to leave early for a doctor's appointment or anything else. Pay is also better than other markets such as Shoprite. Customers usually are not rude, most are nice. Training is pretty decent as well. Is so incredibly busy on weekends, it can be rough working especially if you are older. It is also difficult to get fired unless you are rude to customers. Their policy on calling out is more lenient than any job I ever had. I was late multiple times my last couple of months and no one said anything to me.","After working there for a while, they really do start taking advantage of you. If it is busy, you will have a difficult time leaving on time because the managers never get anyone to replace you on your register. Managers will also ignore you and get annoyed sometimes when you have questions because you have been there for a while. It is impossible to cross-train when starting off on front end because front end has such a high turnover rate. You are on your own very often when working early morning or before close because managers are often wandering off and are not around if you need help. Managers also play favorites. Off register duties such as re-shops and 5S is always given to the same people, the favorites, so they can get off register. Cafe cashier is also given to favorites, and they get to just talk and be on their phones without managers seeing them. There are very few good STL's. Half of them are new with no experience working in a food market. The people who should get promoted do not and end up leaving. They have been hiring from the outside lately, even for coordinators. Self-checkout is also given to favorites so they can stand around and talk to the service desk cashiers. Sometimes my light was flashing and there would be no STL's around to help me and customers would be getting angry. I have also not gotten breaks when working in the evening because it was understaffed. Managers are two-faced and look down on you. HR is great though and very helpful. Hours get severely cut come June and then rise back up come September. Holidays are brutal there. Advancement is difficult also. Really only good for high school and college students. They don't really help you like they claim they will when you first start working there."

1920,Wegmans Food Markets,Great career opportunities and continuous improvement support,2013-01-12,5.0,Front End,"After over two years of working at Wegmans I have began to get the feel of how great the company really is.  If you are willing to commit yourself to work at a fast-paced but friendly environment you will continually grow as an employee.  Wegmans is also very flexible with availabilities.  If you are short scheduled, you can ask for more hours and depending on how open your availability is, they are more than likely to call you.  The extra hours plus the show for dough is very beneficial.",The only one of two miniscule things I can critique about are that breaks can be a bit too short when you have loads of stuff to take care of.  If they extend breaks from 10-15  minutes it will relieve stress for the cashiers so they can get their stuff done and come back once they are done.  The other problem I have is the No Drinks at register policy.  They should make an exception to bottled water to keep at the registers because during the busy shifts the only time that we can make a run to the drinking fountain or the drink station is when there are no customers in our aisle.  Sometimes a rush can last over two hours and sometimes cashiers can get a little bit dehydrated.  Having bottled water at the registers can help cashiers greatly so that they can be able to continue to provide incredible service to our customers.
