0,Workday,Best cultural fit for me,2022-03-07,5.0,Senior Account Manager,"Culture is not a tick in the box but the owners actually believe the company has no reason to exist with the core values of the company.
The technology is extremely strong.
The market is the actual core business of our customers, hence you are very relevant to these customers.","The operational processes are a bit lagging the company growth, but that is being worked on."
1,Workday,Best Company in the World,2022-04-03,5.0,Senior Associate Consultant,Started here straight out of college and was immediately skeptical of how much everyone here loved it. After almost 3 years I can confidently say that if you're going to work a corporate tech job this is the company to do it.,I honestly don't have any cons for the company as a whole besides that they're beginning to lessen our stock grants this year.
2,Workday,"Good work life balance, at cost of below industry standard pay",2022-03-22,4.0,Software Development Engineer II,"They care about their employees & their culture
Many teams at Workday allows for inter company mobility
Good leadership at the C suite level, company direction & growth is great","Below industry standard salary
Most good young engineers leave within a few years because company refuses to pay industry standard (something a lot of companies do that I will never understand, continuity & product knowledge is worth so much)

Promotions are slow to go to the deserving, years at the company is the primary factor. Promotion cycles in general are slow & locked to semi-yearly cycles 

Middle management is murky, not straightforward/honest/realistic about pay structures and hiring practices. Seems as though they are coached to not be transparent

Too much bureaucracy & too many meetings. Lost its startup feel & development can be slow paced at times

Very political about letting employees work remote, very few exceptions granted

Not really allowing remote work"
3,Workday,Turning into the competition,2022-03-21,2.0,Sales,The product is decent and there are some good teammates.,"Where to begin?  The company is more interested in national / global politics than in the company itself. If you are a leftist, this is the place for you. If not, then you will find yourself embarrassed to work here with their constant spouting off on whatever DNCC talking point they receive. 

Pay is mediocre at best.  OTE has not increased in about 10 years (if ever) so there are plenty of other places where the pay is better. They talk about RSUs but those get significantly smaller every year to the point now of barely noticeable.  

Product is still decent but they no longer innovate — except by acquisition which is generally the sign of a company past its prime. The Power of 1 (which used to be a differentiator) is long gone and they have become the same “Frakensoftware”  for which they used to criticize competitors."
4,Workday,Puzzled by bad reviews. Great place to work and friendly workmates all around!,2021-12-29,5.0,Senior Product Manager,"Incredible Sales team and engineering team. Teams are all colocated so that makes software development more agile. Workmates are all friendly, respectful and generally believe in the workday culture. Lot of emphasis on Cultural fit !

RSU granted at date of hire + RSU refresh after a year + PSU awards end of year + Cash bonus plan. Promotions are frequent.

Free Snack options and breakfast are incredible. Handmade espresso drink available as well.

Gym onsite, Bring your dog to work, Clinic on-site, TONNES of conference rooms, fantastic parking + ev charging options. Great location for commuters (right next to BART).

$30/mth Internet stipend, $50/mth Gym and Wellness stipend, $500 WFH stipend. Unlimited PTO is encouraged (especially in holiday season) and there are many holidays observed as well as Thank You Fridays random holidays.","RSU vesting period is 4 years (25% per annum) vs 3 years in many other tech firms
No tuition reimbursement plan
No sleeping pods for naps or massage chairs
Employee attrition has been rising in the last 2 years but it is unknown if this has to do with the pandemic"
5,Workday,Boy’s club,2022-04-02,2.0,Senior Account Manager,"Decent product; however, support is lacking.","While WD speaks a big game about value and and belonging, you have to look far and wide to find any diversity in sales management. The boy’s club is alive and well. 

Serious lack of leadership across the board. Company and culture is really keen on talking about making the place a great place to work; however, when corrective action is required, management simply does not know how to manage. 

HR is a bit of a joke - all good folks, but no influence. 

As a company, there’s a lot of lip service given about employee welfare - yet at every turn, they have fallen in line with the woke agenda. The utter lack of support for employee health is troubling. Follow the science people; folks who’ve had COVID are protected. The vaccine mandates are intrusive."
6,Workday,Woke culture and mandate mania is sending the corporate culture in the wrong direction,2022-01-16,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Overall the corporate vision is sound and inspiring. 

In general, people genuinely want to collaborate and approach problems with positive ""we can figure it out"" rather than blame and finger pointing.","Product delivery is incredibly slow. Despite all the marketing hype, many areas of the product are many years behind the competition and at risk of falling further behind. 

The corporate culture and direction from senior leadership has noticeably deteriorated in recent years to be more aligned with the Woke narrative. A single monolithic narrative is actually the reverse of an inclusive culture where everyone feels valued.

When Workday announced its covid vaxx mandate for all workers, the email was like a kick in the teeth. Upload your vaxx card by X date or you will be terminated. The message was completely counter to the employee first message that Workday tries to promote. Workday's position on vaxx mandate is based on ""we want people to feel safe."" Decisions should be based on data, not emotion. Also the Workday from years ago would have said that employee's personal health data should remain private and should never be required to be shared to the company."
7,Workday,They don’t care about employees,2022-04-02,1.0,Presales Consultant,Nothing that I can think of,"Pay is below average. They took away $7,000 in PSRU stock and tried to cover it up like we are dumb. They claim to do market adjustments but that’s never been do. They claim to do market surveys for salary but they most they give is 3% if you are lucky. They keeping taking stuff away and expect people to be happy. Experiencing above average turnover right now and the only thing they care about is 10 billion."
8,Workday,We've had a challenging few years.,2022-01-16,3.0,Program Manager,"We have great benefits.  We're encouraged to take time off and take care of ourselves.  Thank you Fridays have been very appreciated by many of us as we struggle with balancing children's zoom school with our own work obligations. 

Workmates are smart and typically meet deadlines and obligations . 

All the jobs I've held have had a direct impact on our customer base","VERY liberal management team regularly tells us what to think, which causes to get behind, and even what to inject into our bodies if we want to fully participate in the company.  

Too much focus on DEI and not enough focus on producing world-class software.  People walk on eggshells for fear of offending someone.  Where we used to have bonding chit chat at the beginning of meetings we now just get down to business. 

Aneel has found great success being aligned with the controversial Davos Agenda, billionaires summer camp, and other high-tech movers and shakers.  These organizations lack ethics and were not elected by we the people, yet they believe they should be shaping a globalist future for all countries of the world.  This really concerns me as its undermining the sovereignty of individual nations."
9,Workday,Great Company and Culture,2022-03-28,5.0,Customer Support Analyst,"Work-life balance, Team work, Opportunity to Grow, and Diversity and Inclusion.",Huge ramping period. There is a LOT to learn and it seems like it keeps on growing.

17,Workday,Work life Balance,2022-03-26,5.0,Anonymous Employee,Best in Employee care. Puts Employee first.,Haven’t seen any critical downside
18,Workday,A review,2022-03-31,4.0,Solution Consultant,Great focus on SC enablement at that time I was there and a fun product to work with,"Nothing out of the ordinary, the SC managers were not as familiar with product so could not offer much support. At-bats for the financials part of the Workday solution were limited"
19,Workday,Culture change,2022-04-01,3.0,SRE Engineer,"They act like they care
Try to have fun","But do they really care?
Poor management 
Doesn't seriously take the feedback"
20,Workday,Workday does not truly put Employee first - that is a Myth,2021-12-09,1.0,Senior Director,Good Pay if you are willing to sell your soul and what you stand for and believe.,"- Woke central, should be renamed to WokeDay.

Forces employees to obtain Jab to keep the job even after its been blocked by a court decision. Violates 10th amendment. Violates 1st amendment by asking employees to detail religious beliefs as an excuse that the Employer can use to discriminate against employees, stating that an employee cannot be jabbed because of deeply held religious values and beliefs is all you need to know. Violates Medical Privacy laws by asking intimate health questions and presumably making employment decisions based on those. 

Workday touts that they want a diverse workforce but they are about to loose all of their diversity right out the door to companies who truly do put employees first ( like Oracle - who was the first competitor to stand up for its employees rights ).
**** For any recruiters out there, hit up people from Workday on linkedin, you will make your company the winner from all of this. ***
Workday will be Diversity Free soon!"
21,Workday,Wokeday,2022-01-24,2.0,Marketing Manager,"This place used to be all about rocket growth, great atmosphere, getting things done, great halloween parties. People took a unique interest in you as a person and even after having left over a year ago I still keep in touch with a lot of former workmates.","There are 2 things that happened: 

1) Workday started hiring poor performers and bad middle managers. As those managers hire more people the problem exponentially grows. 
2) The customer focus has been taken hostage by a wokeness that is destroying what was once a great company culture. 

The diversity officer opens and closes company meetings. People get hired based on ethnicity and race. Even the product now has features for Workday's customers to keep track of the racial makeup of their teams. What is happening?!"
22,Workday,Work environment,2022-03-23,5.0,Sales Representative,Workday provided great PTO benefits,Management was not always responsive
23,Workday,Good company and culture,2022-03-31,4.0,Senior Account Executive,Great culture built around solid values. Great product with many successful and happy customers,Growing very fast and becoming very difficult for many net new sales people to achieve quota.

26,Workday,"Great culture, smart people, opportunity to learn a lot",2022-01-05,5.0,Product Manager,Workday has a great culture. Challenging work. Opportunity to learn product management from other talented knowledgeable people. It will stretch you to work cross-functionally to influence and drive your roadmap.,"Easy to get into a scrum-product grinding routine that will go on for years. Hustle and extra effort may not get noticed! Workday is still mostly built on XpressO, a proprietary 'language', and dev with it feels very slow and constrained. Maybe it's just a symptom of a big company, but if your product requires an enhancement from another team or you're trying to get other teams to uptake your work it can be very hard or impossible."

31,Workday,Trust Issues,2022-03-06,3.0,Anonymous Employee,WD as a company is GREAT. People and Purpose organization is hands-down the best out there. ICs across the board are talented and fun to be with.,Micro environment within the organization may not promote and/or aligned with the overall persona of the company. Newly promoted senior leadership in QA Payroll is biting off more than they can handle. There is a lack of understand of how each area of the Payroll product should be focused on.

No longer do you get recognized or promoted for good work. And if you speak up, you are blacklisted and managed out. 

I have watched the company I love be destroyed."
34,Workday,"Great employer, super frustrating design environment",2022-03-19,4.0,User Experience Design Manager,"People-first culture, mostly capable leaders, currently going through major growth spurt and investment in the design org.","Incredibly tough tech constraints prevent ability to do good design, often unable to ship anything meaningful.

Feedback from internal employee engagement doesn't seem to be taken into consideration. Unclear as to actions to help move towards next career path - company trying but options limited.

Very politically biased, some would say way too woke.
The old guard of engineering are pretty dismissive to new people/ideas.
There's a culture of non-collaboration, made especially bad by the rona.
Constantly being told ""things will get better"".
Wayyyy too much red tape when it comes to merging code.

Office and amenities are good.,"Despite the core values on the front page of their website and talked about openly nearly every day you are an employee, I found Workday to be lacking in Integrity and putting Employees First. From the integrity standpoint, in our office there was an individual who was clearly bullying and intimidating others on the team. This individual was reported to management and HR multiple times by multiple people and absolutely no changes were made. In fact, on more than one occasion, when reports were made the reporters were intimidated by management and it was made clear that these reports were not welcome. As for employees first, this is a top down management organization. Despite the talk of collaboration and inclusivity, the day to day is not in the team's hands. It is dictated by management. Finally, there is a severe lack of Human Resources support compared to other organizations I've been in. Finding someone to talk to about HR-related matters was difficult and is clearly a part of the problem."

- Benefits are generous. 
- Mostly great co-workers (you’ll actually want to spend time with them).
- Opportunities for professional development (they’ll pay for courses and trainings).
- Managers are genuinely concerned with employee wellbeing.","- Some products lack strategy or long term vision. Leadership puts it to teams of entry and mid-level employees to “solve” this instead of taking responsibility themselves.
- Bullies and toxic people exist in spite of a culture dominated by niceness and positivity. And because of the culture, the harm they cause is swept under the rug."

- Compensation is lower compared to bay area standard.

There are talented engineers to work with.

Workday clubs are great.

Snack program.

Great for your resume.","Xpresso can be a career limiting technology (though in my opinion it's a powerful technology).

Your quality of life is VERY team dependant. Some teams are great, others have highly toxic politics.

Pay is above average for smaller less established companies but far behind the more established ones.

Promotions aren't common. It kinda feels like there is an ""in crowd"" and then there is everyone else.

Flexible work from home policy isn't. You get Fridays to work from home and anything more that that and your manager will be speaking with you.

Unlimited PTO isn't. It's 4 weeks per year that don't accrue and doesn't pay out when you leave."

Not very supportive, was sat down by a upper leadership multiple times and told to cancel my weekend plans to work (not making this up!). The clientele you work with are very often toxic, you need very thick skin for this role. Outside of the professional services arm, the company's innovation is really limited to updating technology to support existing industry practices, rather than actually creating new technology standards for the market to adapt.

It  is refreshing to work for a company that is socially responsible.  Workday also has a number of perks, that while are becoming a standard in the Tech industry, are still nice to have. Things like an enhanced snack program, matching charitable contributions, and decent health insurance keep Workday a competitive employer.","A lot has changed over the years, and it hasn’t really been for the better. In Workday’s growth it has struggled to keep the experience the same for all employees. Managers have so much control over their subordinate’s Workday experience that many rule like they’re kings of tiny hills. In my time here I’ve witnessed managers cut salaries when subordinates moved 50miles away (but still within the Bay Area), managers insist that subordinates checkin on slack before going to the restroom, and managers creating jobs and hiring their friends to fill them.  This type of behavior is just plain sad, Workday is supposed to be better than this."

Overworked is an understatement. Very little work life balance is offered. Even during COVID, people were overworked and then scolded when the company felt like there was a decrease in productivity - demonstrating very little sympathy for people attempting to perform their job while managing children doing virtual school. They use this as a continual excuse to not follow the industry in becoming a predominantly virtual company and telling everyone they will have to go back to the office (this keeps getting pushed off because of CDC recommendations, but remains their goal). Meanwhile, their profits are up, their stock is up, but most people only got cost of living raises this year. They're giving out less and less stock, despite their ever-increasing profits. 
They push political views via company email and attempt to brand it as something everyone must agree with. Unprofessional political opinions are openly shared at the executive level and during company meetings that have little to nothing to do with the business. 
Entirely too much internal promoting, resulting in a large percentage of upper management and key leadership that does not have the experience or mentorship to make the right decisions for the business, resulting in many lost opportunities. Success is hinged far more on a good economy and very little industry competition than high level leadership."

I mean enough can't be said about how great the company is, especially as it relates to it's people","I've noticed this as of late, that a lot of the original folks that help make this company great, are now leaving. While interacting with these individuals, it relates to a similar experience I had. Now, the company would rather hire externally than provide individuals who have been at the company with an opportunity to take on a new role. Years ago, people didn't look at your years of experience but rather what you were doing at the moment and whether you can deliver value in an area we needed to focus on. That has changed... It seems like to grow, you have to be coming from the outside. Folks that have been here for a while don't seem to receive the same type of respect they used to give or take the same amount of risk or believing in someone. I really hope this can be fixed because Workday is a great place to work but the people who helped get it there should not be forgotten."

It follows you afterward. I requested some personal information from Workday and all I hear are crickets. If you are not one of the popular kids you are treated like trash. I was treated like trash and not in the ""In Crowd"" when I worked there and it would seem that that continues after you leave. I love my new job.

If you want to experience and work with 90s logic/technologies then this is the place to be.","- Team managers are untrained and immature. They are not really knowledgeable and are involved in killing the culture.
- Riddled with politics (if you are coloured, then they will have a go at you at some point for sure!).
- Nobody trusts each other. 
- Tech teams/developers are stuck with old useless framework.
- Everybody speaks behind other's backs and the entire experience is so bad.
- New joinees are bullied almost always (if you are of south asian origin!).

I don't even know why this place is called one of the best places to work."
206,Workday,A culture of 'phoning it in',2021-07-04,2.0,Software Development Engineer II,"*** by and large defined by the team you're on
- ***WLB is great
- By-and-large, really solid benefits (401k, insurance, stock options, mat/pat leave)
- Lots of small random benefits (e.g. SF Giants tickets, or discount on some clothing line)
- A really solid infrastructure for Diversity (will elaborate in cons)
- ***A lot of interesting tech opportunities, due in part to the proprietary technology (if you're not in App-Dev). A good stepping stone, or place to settle in for awhile
- Generation Workday Tools Intern rotation is good college learning experience
- Generally speaking, chill people","- There really isn't much clear direction. Things are just kinda, happening, and maybe you're doing the important work or maybe you're in a pigeon-hole. Problems are usually re-orged into obscurity instead of addressed in any meaningful way. It's additionally really chaotic for developers with constantly changing team-structure and vision
- App-Dev (Applications Development): The proprietary language really does limit how much one learns in the role, and management knows that. The tech stack is diversifying, but expect to fight one another for the opportunities, which are far and few. Initiatives meant for developers keep getting led-along (maybe because of poor direction)
- Cash salary is low, for the scale of the company. Compensation primarily comes from stock packages that lock you in for X-number-of-years (I'll acknowledge that some individuals seek out stock)
- Leadership is AGGRESSIVELY anti-remote work, come post-covid (the phrase ""remote work will be rare"" is the common phrase)
- Diversity initiatives haven't gone much further than step 1. Lots of corporate infrastructure, resources, etc., but individual/team experience is really hit-or-miss
- App Dev Intern role is not a good college learning experience
- The ""Workday Culture"" is just, weird... leadership talks down a lot, like a paternal figure, stuck reminiscing about 'The Good Old Days' (from like, 4 years ago). Personality precedes performance, persistently, especially if you can be 'One of the bro's' (really bad in some depts). And in general, you feel like an outsider if you don't view your job as more than a job, and the psychological toll is real. The unfortunate thing is that this also includes your background, as well as personality. 

DONT GET ME WRONG. There are some AMAZING teams, who respect one another, foster psychological/emotional safety for all identities, and have a constant curiosity. There are some AMAZING managers who are focused on the person, not your output. However, there are as many teams who foster an exclusionary crony-culture that strives for image instead of meaningful work. And sometimes those things are just a re-org away."
207,Workday,"Great Company, but don't join BT org.",2021-10-25,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Excellent products, Good benefits, some fantastic leaders you can look up to!","Do not join BT (business technology Org). Toxic culture, unethical leadership, no transparency, and no work-life balance."

Pandemic support - extra paycheck at the start of the pandemic, some organizations have designated no-meeting days (not all managers respect them), flexible working schedules","Leadership is lacking - big egos, reactive, politicking, top-down decision making

Limited career development - opportunities/promotions are reserved for management favorites vs high-performers; large investment put into hiring with very little effort to support, grow and retain existing employees

In-person culture - requiring people back in office, limited remote opportunities, indecisive about vaccination policy"

217,Workday,Culture and company changing for the worse,2021-07-01,1.0,Software Engineer,"- Unlimited PTO, recently expanded parental leave
- Good healthcare, vision, and dental benefits.","- Mandatory ""diversity"" training is basically pushing a political agenda. If you want to say ""mother"" instead of ""birthing person"" like they want you to, that's a conversation with your manager for not being ""inclusive"". Yikes.

- Seasoned people are leaving and management doesn't even try to hold onto them. Ironic, because they were the ones preserving Workday culture. In my first week my manager who had been at the company for 5 years left and I had nothing to do for months as my new manager dealt with the consequences.

- Strict no full-remote work policy. Doesn't make any sense either since many teams are distributed and meeting over Zoom anyways."

The company truly care about its employees. 
Very good snack programs. 
Great opportunities within the company and career growth, at least this is how I feel. encourages internal transfers and personal career growth but I think it is expected that employees has to be initiative.  
A lot technical challenges to overcome,which presents opportunity to grow and improve. 
Managements constantly engage with employees to find out pain points and challenges using skip level meetings, which shows they truly care or at least they are trying.","A lot of pros I mentioned might be listed as cons in other reviews. 

However it's very hard to give a very objective views in general about the company so in this case look at how the company fairs in ""Great Place to Work."", which I believe speaks volume. 

 Depending on the team and location same thing can be positive/cons at the same time. 

As for personal career growth it is expected that employees have to be initiative and actively engage. don't expect that just working hard and get recognized. don't wait to be put into position to grow. be initiative."

Workday likes to say that it values employees first but this gets lost in middle management. At least in my experience, I had to work incredibly hard to get promotions and still got passed up for one. Was given no actionable feedback and instead was told “keep doing what you’re doing, it’s just not your time.” When I applied to other teams, management decided they couldn’t let me go too quickly since they couldn’t backfill my position due to lack of experienced resources. Middle management is also not very inclusive, there’s a whole initiative team that was formed to address these issues but even that team isn’t too diverse. It’s a bit expected for a company this size but disappointing to say the least."

289,Workday,How Things Have Changed,2021-03-22,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"Good benefits, perks, pay, and unlimited PTO","So when I started at Workday, I loved it. I belonged to a great team and had an amazing manager. Once he left things went downhill. A new manager was promoted to SR Manager mainly because this was the manager with the most seniority. Sad but true. 

Things moved along not getting better but slowly getting worse. 4 years down the road, another new manager and things are really bad. I am not a disgruntled employee. I still love my team. I just can't work under a ""manager"" that is a bully. This person will target anyone that doesn't tow the line. This so-called manager has targeted not only myself but another employee simply because we question the manager's opinions. I, personally, reached out to HR. I was told that I needed to give the manager a chance to improve which I was open to but not hopeful. That went sideways as now that I went to HR now this manager has more issues. Went back to HR as this is perceived as retaliation and was told again that they would investigate. Gave HR the name of another employee dealing with the same issues and to this day 2-3 weeks later HR has not contacted that employee nor myself. It is sad really that they are promoting a hostile work environment but refuse to do anything. No follow-up at all. Not even an email saying they are still ""investigating"". I am very disillusioned by what has happened here. And the Sr. Manager over the lower level manager does nothing. I was told that there would be skip level meetings but nothing so far. The things that this ""manager"" is saying to employees while not illegal are demoralizing and inappropriate. This manager even blames the employee for the bad reactions. ""Saying you made me mad so I said those things."" Not an excuse. But again, sadly, HR does nothing. Other than this I have no complaints about Workday. I love what the culture is supposed to be. I love the team that I am on. They are all really great people and honestly they have our backs. Unfortunately, leadership can't be trusted."
290,Workday,PM at Workday,2021-08-03,4.0,Product Manager,"Workday offers wonderful work life balance, good benefits, and a great culture.

""Employee first"" mindset.

Diversity and Inclusion is a real thing, not just words.

Strong compensation and benefits.","The clash of the ""Old timers"" who vehemently adhere and advocate the ""Workday Way"", and the ""new timers"" who are driving to ""get stuff done"" instead of focusing so much on making Workmates happy, is causing issues/conflicts. 

As a result, the culture is starting to break down - in some areas more and faster than others. Though there are executives who believe (privately, not publicly) that the shift to ""get stuff done"" is overdue and are actively taking steps to change the culture away from ""employees first"".

As a people leader, you are caught between keeping your employees happy (weekly employee sat survey and quarterly reports on the results) and driving for results. Managing through this (unofficial, unstated, and inconsistently applied) culture change is frustrating due to the mixed messages from senior leadership and executive leadership.

I recommend Workday to someone applying for an IC role. I do not recommend Workday to someone applying for a people leader position."

Most teams seem pretty happy and led by good managers.,"It's hard to get to director-level or above unless you're an outside hire. Recent leadership hires don't care about the company as much as people who have been there since the early days. A lot of people who helped build the company have left or been sidelined in the last couple of years, which is too bad. 

When both Dave and Aneel were in charge, Workday had a good balance between vision and growth. Now that Dave (the visionary) is retired, Aneel (the venture capitalist) focuses more on growth. 

Some of the recent senior leadership promotions are questionable. They seem to be driven either by proving that we treat our acquired companies' leaders really well, or by rewarding sales-focused people."

These people are bright, humble, kind-hearted, and willing to go out of their way to help me be successful. I left Workday with many lifelong friendships and connections.

Although it wasn't so much the case by the time I left given the size of the company, I had many opportunities to make significant impact on customers with the various products I led, either from scratch or enhanced. Being a PM at Workday for 6 years gave the kind of enterprise experience that many other companies value and seek. Despite my no longer being there, I am very grateful for my time at Workday.","Leadership quality, from front-line all the way up to the executive ranks, is sorely lacking. There was no clear product strategy/vision, priorities were constantly changing, and politics were rife. Workday grew too fast and brought in too many external folks that had significant responsibility/power but had no idea what Workday was about. What's worse was that they didn't trust nor respect their employees' input and experience. As a result, the culture Workday is so proud of is rapidly deteriorating. Many talented people are leaving for other opportunities."

Middle manager I had was domineering. 
When I left, there seems to be an addiction to adding more processes and procedures that overly complicates simple things.
Recent managers are unnecessarily micro managing trivial things.
There are groups I worked with that were visibly political and catty.
Favoritism was very evident towards some employee who were very good at sucking up.
It was becoming bureaucratic by the time I left. 
Managers were instructed to have a formal meeting with employees every week, taking valuable time away from productive work.
I experienced the usual office politics of people attacking behind my back which I will end up hearing later on from a manager."

The two areas that have seen the most dilution are Integrity and Customers. The goal of being a $10billion company has clearly changed our priorities - to the extent that we no longer place a value on our promises. 

I was dismayed when one of the GMs said our focus is no longer on Customers. All our effort now must be directed toward opening new SKUs for sales at the expense of improving our core products. Leaders in other pillars have made similar comments that we wouldn't necessarily honor existing customer promises. These ideas are in direct contradiction to the company I joined.

If you're looking to join Workday, make sure you select a growing or new product line. And leave your integrity at the door."

Compensation is good, stock has good value. Employee stock purchase program pretty much always turns a profit (~+15% income at least)

Good work like balance if you choose.

Can be a good place to stay for a long time career path in company permitting. If you are in a role with proprietary knowledge that the company needs you have strong negotiation power to get a raise with real threats to leave(other opportunities). That in conjunction with staying to get stock is excellent financially. Working in services(with customers) can give you a good position to lead installations at customer companies.

Networking inside the company is highly encouraged and supported.","Performance reviews are more like a self review that neither the employee or manager knows how to do. If you want a promotion ask for it and make a plan or leave.

Your work (team reliant) may give you non-marketable skills unless you're going to stay within the workday product.

Your work may not be important in the long run due to decisions made by poor communication along the management chain. Always find out how you fit into the bigger picture and see if you and everyone else agrees with the value of your project.

Promotions can be less merit based and more if people like you based which can be good depending on who you are. Also very opportunity based. People want to support you, but you can only really move if there are spots. Promotions are very much possible and everyone celebrates it, only if you make it happen."

Not a performance culture. Management doesn’t base rewards and promotion on  delivering good tech and products to customers.

Leadership of ML team is good at managing up but don’t actually fix issues. They burry problems and keep low performers so they don’t have to deal with red tape of HR. Maybe management could do useful things like get us data?

Had stocked food, a gym (at the HQ), fun festivals etc. It was like a carnival Friday","A high percentage of people that Work at workday are referred in, and I was a one off applicant. A LOT OF NEPOTISM. Perfectionistic team, that had no idea how to teach me something when I needed help and my manager was 26. She had lack of empathy, she couldn't understand me at an emotional level, and barley knew how to guide me and get me to know the ropes. When I was starting to 'underperform' due to my managers performance, tensions got really high and kept sinking to a low. They did not give me the choice to move to a different position. It's a shame for being branded as top performing company. 

Being an entrepreneur, it was hostile in terms of not being able to move from one are of the company to the other (at least to learn) when not in any meetings. The people who hired me (4 at a time), were not on my team when hired, which made the team dynamic intensely different.

******ATTN: If you are going to be a consultant, they made you take two tough exams that a lot of people fail. I was not aware of this IN MY INTERVIEW, and was told AFTER I WAS HIRED."

The product is amazing and the vision of the company is good but there are many bad managers and there is no formal 360 feedback to control their performance.  Workday has a great product and leadership has a great vision,  but sadly it is losing great talent because of the toxic work culture created by new managers in the middle management.","The culture of the company is deteriorating.   There are too many managers but less individual contributors, so the individual contributors get buried with workload.  While the new managers are busy playing politics to secure their positions.  The managers throw their direct reports under the bus to score points with internal clients and upper management. The worker bees feel dissatisfied, undervalued and disrespected.  As a result the attrition rate is very high and something needs to be done to change the culture."

Encouragement for People Leaders to grow and training for them on a new way of managing
Senior Leadership optimism and support for new ideas","Regardless of HR/People & Purpose communication, organizational and leadership changes are selected and appointed based on their tight network, which creates the inability for others to see a path forward toward leadership.  Additionally, those leaders select people like them (in style, view point, color, gender, background) or that they've known a long time, which feels like the same ""good ol' boy network"".
Many of the appointed leaders are white men, with an occasional nod to a (white) woman or man of color.  And as they senior leadership is shifted around, creating potential opportunities for workmates to show interest in management, those management spots are also appointed. 
It's beginning to feel like the senior leadership is excited for growth and changes, but in the end leaving those of us who are looking for opportunities feeling like we have none, and we're expected to rally behind the changes regardless.
The ethnic diversity in senior leadership and in management is so minimal that it's discouraging to believe in their words during VIBE week of diversity being important."

Leadership is probably the best I’ve ever encountered - they genuinely care about their people  and look out for us. Aneel Bhusri is arguably the best CEO I’ve seen.","The size of the organization has created too many silos, many of which have lost touch with the philosophy of the company (“The Workday Way”). My manager failed to communicate effectively and was in over their head. Frequent shuffling and reorganization made for a difficult and somewhat degrading environment. And recent acquisitions, while good in a strategic sense, have not integrated well into the Workday ecosystem at all. Above all, don’t be surprised if you are hired for a role that was not as advertised or even misrepresented. To me that was the worst thing of all."

- don't expect to be promoted quickly, everyone has to do their time in their role before they can even think about moving into another role"
493,Workday,Really is a great place to work!,2020-04-13,5.0,Product Manager,"* The culture is really great, in practice what this means is that people are easy to work with, management doesn't (typically) micro-manage, people are trusted, benefits are generous, if you need time off you can take it, etc. Also plenty of interest groups, competitions, socials. Team outings are encouraged.

* The product is a sticky one that has a big impact on the world. The biggest companies in the world use our product and its exciting to build products that can impact millions of employees for the better. There's a lot of growth to be had and we are continuously expanding our product lines.

* There is a lot of room for internal mobility! You are not stuck in the role you were hired into (at least after one year of serving in that role). You can move to different teams or even different roles altogether. This is a great place to grow your career if you are motivated and willing to speak up for yourself with your manager. Some examples I'm aware of: Developer -> PM, Pre-Sales. QA -> Developer, PM

* Compensation is about average for the bay area, but that is still pretty good! You typically will get decent base salary and RSU package (e.g. 40k over 4 years). This grows each year as you get a ""refresh"" (e.g. another 40k over 4 years). After 4 years you have 4 grants vesting at the same time in April (our comp cycle). That can be 10k raise each year even if you don't have a boost in base salary.","* Volatile stock means volatile compensation when much of it is from RSUs. But this can also be to your favor if you hold long term. When I joined my RSUs were granted at a local maxima price and dropped shortly after, only recovering (and then dramatically surpassing) that price 2 years later. But the following year or two was a surge in Workday's price which led to significant inflation of my compensation. 

* Don't expect significant base salary raises unless it is a major promotion and you are a good negotiator. Often you won't get any base salary increase, and other times you might get 1-3%. It is difficult to negotiate once you get your annual review and compensation update, the budget has already been allocated and agreed to a month+ prior. If you negotiate successfully you may only see a bump months later.

* Depending on your team you may have FREQUENT re-organizations, even up to 2-3 times a year. Which could mean new manager and change in your charter. If you are an IC, you are usually not consulted on this and simply have to deal with it. Even director level folks are sometimes not consulted with on these changes, and we have seen turn over due to undesirable changes from a re-org (for certain people). I've been at workday for many years now and have had more manager than years employed. It has its pros and cons, and it has to do with which teams you join. 

* The team you join MATTERS. If you join a team that is focused on a legacy product, you can chill more and could be a good place to be to ""rest and vest"" and have time to take care of your family (leave early to pick them up from school, etc.) If you join an innovative team that is pushing through new product lines, there is a higher expectation and just cruising will look bad. If you are a motivated individual, I urge against joining (or at least saying long term) in a team that is of the ""cruising"" archetype. Take advantage of the internal mobility and join an innovative team to grow your career.

* Office locations aren't ideal. Depending on your values, Pleasanton HQ can be good or bad. If you live in the east bay, it's obviously good. If you live in SF it's less good. There is an SF office, but you should assume you will not be working there (unless you're joining Scout, or are in corporate comms, marketing, etc.) There other offices are Boulder, Portland, Victoria (BC), Dublin (Ireland), so if you want to live somewhere warm Pleasanton is the only option. Boulder seems to be the second most active office after Pleasanton and we're doing a lot more hiring there if that's your interest.

* Occasionally, management talks politics (US politics), and I feel like this can alienate many employees. Even if the majority agrees with the politics, there are at least 40% of employees who feel alienated. I don't think this company should involve itself in controversial politics. It's certainly not as bad as some other tech companies though in this regard though!"

Everything is controlled by your manager. eg. Compensation, promotio... You will never have a voice in this company. They have many tricky ways to force you to leave. 
2. XpressO is a career tramp. It adds no value to your technical skills and no one in the industry cares about XO. New graduates, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE stay away from Workday. I joined as a GW, and it is a nightmare for me in the last three years.
3. Politics is the ""root"" of this company. People complain a lot and it got worse and worse. Middle management is playing politics to bring friends and lay off those who they don't like.

He is allowed to mentally abuse me for lack of a better phrase, has threatened my career and played mind games with me all in an attempt to make himself feel better and feed his huge ego. I feel this is an indicator of a bigger issue at Workday with management and the amount of leeway they are given coupled with the lack of management training and experience across leaders, even at senior levels. Coincidentally, the times when I have been extremely successful are the same times my boss has decided to berate me, belittle me and overall try to make me feel bad rather than lifting me up, motivating me and helping with my career progression. His comments to me are in complete contradiction with the very positive feedback I receive from everyone else which is clearly a huge issue that needs to be addressed but unfortunately there is no one to talk to as HR for individual contributors is outsourced (surprising). There is a serious lack of maturity which I would expect to have in a manager and it’s almost to the point that I feel Workday is allowing a hostile work environment by not addressing the issues. The sad part about all this is that I love Workday (the product), I’m an extremely loyal employee and thought I would be here forever. I’m self-motivated, a go-getter and I have tons of energy and excitement but unfortunately that is waning quickly given how the company is allowing me to be treated. It’s a classic case of top talent wanting leaving because of a bad manager."

570,Workday,A sinking ship,2019-12-31,1.0,Software Engineer,"I worked at Adaptive Insights Business Unit and what was once a quirky startup that had poker tables, a band that played every so often, parties for every sort of holiday that you could think of. There used to be a forward thinking idea of pushing better tools to produce software. There was incentives to stick around while workday absorbed the business unit.","The unit has changed into a large corporate structure where OKRs, organizational key results rule supreme. Middle managers weaponize OKRs for their personal gains. Middle managers are constantly looking for scapegoats, shifting blames and unwanted OKRs to other teams. The business unit constantly misses targets and therefore applies incredible pressure to the teams. Poor communication amongst managers, the constant need to fulfill one manager's requirements while the other is upset that your unable to fulfill their requirements. Managers publically insulting other teams. The software code is incredibly poorly written. Numberous security holes, use of very old software. Imagine working with very old school engineers who don't care to improve the setup nor are they really helping you to do your job. If your planning to do work here, most likely these engineers will sit around attempt criticize whatever work you do in an attempt to maintain relevance."
571,Workday,From Good to Great to Average...and trending downward...,2016-03-21,3.0,Anonymous Employee,"Industry leading product that continues to pull ahead of the competition
Really great co-workers who are smart, work hard, and are down to Earth
Decent work/life balance unlimited PTO (in reality it depends on department/manager)
Flexible with working from home (in reality it depends on role/manager)
Company is continuing to grow and is doing great things in the HCM, Finance, and Higher Education space
Free snacks/drinks/bagels in the breakroom (if you really care about this)","Becoming increasingly bureaucratic
Below market pay
Promotions are few and far between (lots of lip service from managers) and very little transparency into how compensation/performance cycles really work


All of the reviews about it not being the same Workday in as little as 2 years+ ago are true. The company has been growing extremely fast which isn't necessarily a con, but in the case of Workday, I feel like it has been especially in how the culture of the company has been affected. Workday used to be a great place to work with very much a startup like vibe and the culture that also reflected what I felt was Workday's true culture. However, too many great employees that have been loyal to the company are beginning to leave or are looking to leave because they get passed up for promotions and instead end up with the responsibility of training new colleagues and managers who will make more than them for doing essentially the same work. You see this trend in multiple departments within the company. Most of the mid-upper management positions will be hired in from the outside and most of those managers will manage up and delegate menial tasks to their direct reports. 

The 'company culture' isn't really enforced and most of middle-management probably could not care less about it, at least that's how it feels now and I've been watching this trend for 1.5 years.

I truly believe that executive management has employees bests interests at heart and talks about being transparent and gathering feedback often, but there hasn't been an environment that's been created where employees feel comfortable with speaking their minds because usually their managers are also in the room when these topics are mentioned. Aside from a few solid managers (true leaders as I like to call them) that truly care about their teams and work tirelessly to mentor, develop, and grow their members so that they succeed, it seems as though the rest are just concerned about themselves and making sure they look good for their managers so they can move onto the next best thing. Some managers are really nice and great people, but they don't fight for their employees when issues arise or when it comes to compensation and promotions, which is disappointing.

There's a reason why employees are taking to Glassdoor to express their frustrations because there really isn't any other avenue aside from complaining to your co-workers (which happens often). I truly hope to see this change and that we'll get back to being the same great Workday we once were."
572,Workday,Nothing But LOVE for Workday,2016-07-30,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Workday is the BEST company I have ever worked for, and I have worked for some really great companies. Time and time again I’m impressed. Leadership is open and honest. They treat us well with beautiful offices, free snacks, game rooms, team building events, family-friendly functions, and more. The company culture is a great foundation started by Aneel and Dave. What other companies have Fun and Employees as core values? 

If you are driven but not a bulldozer, work well in a team but don't need to be micromanaged, care about your customers, whether internal or external, and treat people as you'd like to be treated, with mutual respect and empathy, then Workday is the place for you.","My cons aren't with Workday. They're with the Workmates who are here and don't appreciate what they have. They lack one thing – gratitude. Instead, they’re entitled and it’s shameful. My friends and family are in awe of everything we have here because it doesn’t exist for them in their workplace. 

It's unfortunate to see negative reviews of Workday since it makes me wonder what the person who wrote it is doing to rectify their own situation. If you have a problem, address it with someone who can help (and that’s not venting to a co-worker, although that does feel good). Don't hide behind a keyboard with anonymous posts. It won’t get you anywhere. And if you don’t like it here, it’s pretty simple; find your dream job elsewhere and we’ll wish you well."

401k matching (with after tax 401k contributions allowed)","I don’t think it’s possible to deny that Workday has some positive attributes. I’m sure some people can go through their career there without a hitch. But I think I can safely say that if you want a great software engineering career, you need to do much better than working in the apps org at Workday. I think joining the Apps was the biggest mistake in my entire life, setting me back years in my professional development.

And it’s not just working in XpressO. At the end of my tenure I came to appreciate the things it did well. It’s more the lack of insight into any part of the technical stack, and the subpar technical leadership in Apps. Almost every manager I had during my tenure were Peoplesoft->Oracle->Workday, so several years away from the technical cutting edge. The lack of almost any technical know-how forces nonsense metrics to be the measure of an engineers ability, such as number of commits in a month, or how many comments were posted on a code review. Issues with my manager disappeared when I started committing near blank code to keep my number up, and started telling my peers to give me comments on my code reviews directly instead of on the code review tool. And I know for a fact it’s not just me who dealt with this.

Workday appears to hire three types of people in apps: college students who don’t know any better, older folk who don’t care anymore about being on the bleeding edge and just want a stable 9-5, and managers who worked at Peoplesoft at some point. Not exactly the ideal combination for what should be a high performance team."

Great break room with free coffee, soda, juice, tons of difference snacks, food in the fridge and free Einsteins bagels every single morning.","Things change drastically, way too often and once you’ve been able to get a grip on those changes, they change again. The Corporate Sales Development department in particular is forcing its way to becoming a call center. It is no longer prospect driven it is now activity driven. It doesn’t matter if you’re hitting, or in my case, exceeding your quarterly quota within the first month of it. If you are not meeting the leadership placed requirements of calls during their “Power hours” you will not be recognized or recommended to get promoted or change roles. They purposely hire young kids fresh out of college with no prior job experience and pay them a decent base pay plus commission so that they can mold the kids to their way. They want “yes” people who say yes to any changes even if they are terrible ones. The minute you speak your mind about how wrong pushing these changes on people is they start treating you differently, and the difference is VERY evident and even uncomfortable. They will praise the person with 100 dials a day and 30% of quota and use them as an example of what is expected while the person with 20 dials a day and 130% of quota gets told they “are not performing.” Its truly sad because as a company is truly an amazing company. I would recommend working at Workday in any other department but CSD. They dont accept people who have their own style and experience in sales development that works. You won’t be appreciated."

If you get inspired to do something that you think will help the business because you see friction in a process or an inefficiency, just forget it.  Honestly, it’s not worth the effort unless you’re favored by management. It is utterly demoralizing to have this experience at a company that is losing money every quarter. Everyone is in denial about the lack of profitability, but somehow all will be solved when WD breathes the “rarefied air” of a $10 billion valuation. Go for it, just don’t expect to keep your best place to work designation with how you’re going about it."

Strong sense of mission and future. Great founders - easy to rally behind. Solid pay, good benefits.","Not the place to go if you want to advance your career. I love the work, but Workday has been the worst career choice in my life. No way to get ahead. Look elsewhere if you want to grow.  If you want to do the same job under frequently changing managers and empty promises, join the team."
645,Workday,Avoid This Place,2019-09-04,1.0,Consultant,There's lots of hype about it being a great place to work.,"I've been at Workday five months. It's a total disaster. Most of the employees I've encountered seem to have no idea what they're doing or how a business works. This extends to managers. To make it worse, the more ignorant, the more arrogant. I have never seen anything like it in my 20+ years working. There is also rampant nepotism and petty politics that makes for a toxic environment. Give serious thought to what you're getting into before you accept a job here."
646,Workday,Slow Steady Decline,2019-10-17,2.0,Software Engineer,Culture is fairly good and diverse workforce,"Inexperienced management team has a negative effect on individual contributors - Raising issues is met with harsh criticism and risk of discontinued employment. 
Lots of attrition and lateral movement across teams due to dis-satisfaction with management, causing teams to have to ""start over"" frequently ... this reduces the quality of the product and slows innovation.
New employees often receive little to no on-boarding."
647,Workday,Work culture,2019-10-16,4.0,Program Manager,Relatively relaxed work pace compared to many other tech companies. Better work-life balance.,"Culture and values are oversold. It does not trickle down to line managers who have their own baggage from their previous experiences and work culture. People don't seem so driven to work that work does not seem work, it's so enjoyable! That's not great for the younger workers to thrive in the industry and be sought after. The proprietary programming language most developers use, is also an issue. 

It's generally hard to get in even through internal referrals!"

Employees are not your kids that you can scold whenever your mood tells you to.  Drive workload and blame team members when things go wrong.  Refuse to take any responsibilities themselves.  Weekly Best Workday Pulse Survey won't work when you have a small team.  That means easy identification and retribution, either you leave or suck it up.  Some group have high turnovers.

658,Workday,S.O.S Dave Duffield,2016-01-30,2.0,Anonymous Employee,I've been at Workday for 3+ years.  I have to say it still has quite a bit of smart and talented people.  Workday still has a lot of untapped potential.  The brand is now recognized worldwide and we are #2 as the best place to work.,"Dave if you're reading this please come back and help ensure our culture is not being hijacked.  If you are a fellow Workday employee please up vote thus if you agree.  Where should I begin?
There are an influx of Oracle-like managers.  They are in development, sales, and director roles.  They don't care about their employees.  They spend all their time making themselves look good rather than worrying about the culture, its employees and the best for our company and customers.  It's become really corporate and political fast.  A lot of the original Workday people are being pushed out because of this.
These managers are hiring senior, principal roles externally rather than promote within.  Most likely hiring people who agree with their agenda rather than based on merit.  In Support one Senior integrations engineer was overlooked for a managerial position.  They hired some one much younger with no integration experience.
HR has a history of not doing anything.  I've had multiple colleagues complain to hr only to be reprimanded by thier manager after they found out.  You have to complain to the head of Hr Kim roa to get anything done.
Trying to change or improve anything is frown upon.  VPs and directors are where they are at because they insist on using antiquated systems and procedures  They don't support innovation since it makes their day to day activities obsolete.  They strive in this broken system because thats how they remain visible and relevant.  You improve or fix the system and they basically aren't useful anymore."
659,Workday,No opportunities...,2019-09-09,1.0,Presales,There are some great people. But an equal amount of not so great who bring down the culture.,"No opportunities to have any sort ownership on deals unless you are one of a handful of people in Presales who leadership has decided to develop.  Sales and leadership have selective hearing and don’t value ideas or opinions of all team members. No diversity, especially in sales. Mostly white males 30s-50s. Depending on who you are assigned to work with, can often be a hostile work environment. If you have one off day at a meeting, expect to be given zero to minimal opportunities for a foreseeable future, and especially not with any sort of deal ownership/leadership capacity. Sales Club for Presales is a joke. Except not to be told about not making Club until Sales Kickoff when you’re forced to sit in the back of the room for keynotes and other speakers."
660,Workday,Finance Ops: Great environment - don't pay attention to obvious smear campaign,2018-11-19,5.0,Finance Ops,"Great company, great culture. Very fast paced environment that keeps life interesting and challenging. Extremely supportive local management that puts in tremendous hours and effort trying to build something great. 

Seriously if you aren't happy here - you need to take a look in the mirror. It's highly collaborative, and management really sincerely cares about you.","You may have read a number of negative reviews about Finance Ops in Salt Lake City. It's obviously a smear campaign from a jilted current or former employee using multiple accounts to post what they want you to believe is representative of an overwhelmingly negative atmosphere. The problem is - that's the polar opposite of the reality which is obvious if you spend a few minutes talking to anyone in the department about their experience. 

Don't believe this is an orchestrated campaign? Read all of the finance reviews chronologically in SLC. You'll see 1-2 posts every month, most of them positive. Suddenly there are 10 posts in a 10 day span in November - all with similar themes.  Coincidence? You be the judge. 

If you can't do well here, why have you not pursued other opportunities? The market is very employee friendly (lowest unemployment in decades), you are obviously a self-appointed superstar, and having exposure to Workday software is a hot commodity. No? You'd rather stay, be miserable in this *awful culture* and just complain to the world about it? Makes perfect sense."
661,Workday,Great company with a focus on their employees,2019-11-02,4.0,Accounting Manager,Workday gives you the tools you need to do the job well. There is an incredible focus on the people that work them. The company really does strive to enable their employees to have a balance between personal and professional life.,"A career framework has been put in place for every department to enable growth. However, the only real way to get a substantial position increase or pay bump is to leave the company and come back."
662,Workday,"Great work life balance, fun work",2019-09-16,5.0,Software Engineer,"Good work life balance, fun team and managers really seem to care about you and your happiness. If you want to work harder, your manager will definitely help you. If you’re interested in other projects and technologies, your manager will do his/her best to help you out. Overall, it’s a great place to learn from smart engineers, and grow as a person.","No free lunch, but there is a lot of on campus dining options that makes it okay."
663,Workday,A company with real values...,2016-08-01,5.0,Anonymous Employee,"Let's face it, we have all worked for good and bad companies. To say that Workday is not the best company you can be a part of would be an understatement. It's a shame that people who are still employed with the company could have such harsh words for an organization that puts their employees at the forefront. Workday spends alot of money every year to make sure that our families are involved in events, provides us with awesome perks and emphasizes work-life balance. In addition, Management is extremely honest and approachable. What other large corporations can you call the CEO, Presidents and others by their first name when you see them in the elevator? They are always quick to answer a question and truly want to know what's going on. Sorry, they can't always sit down to have a personal conversation with you about your issue, they are busy RUNNING A COMPANY to make us as successful as possible.  We are grown ups, use the appropriate channels provided to you.

It's unfortunate that Glassdoor has turned into a wailing wall for those that no longer work at Workday probably for valid reasons. If you do still work there, I hope you change your minds. The grass is not always greener in the other side, no matter what to feel your entitled to.","I have no cons other than people who feel that they are owed something and complain when it's not ""rightfully"" handed to them."

673,Workday,"The ""Great Culture"" does not permeate throughout the entire organization",2015-12-11,2.0,Manager,"Lots of snacks and bagels.
Work life balance and probably good managers  can be found if you are lucky enough to work in the right department.  The company spends a lot of money on Workday Generation so if you are a young person, that is definitely a pro for you.  The company has recently had a lot of various workshops for management skills, managing priorities, etc. which I think is a step in the right direction.  There are opportunities outside of your department to move into.
Things can be a lot worse.","In reading some of the more critical but most useful reviews, I realize I am not alone.  I am only talking about my personal experience and not putting down anyone who has truly had an amazing experience here.  This is a very political and clicky culture and people seem threatened by talent, and afraid to step on the wrong toes.  Workday tries to give the appearance that they have this great culture but maybe what once were great ideals have warped into this superficial, passive aggressive one that promotes weak leadership, and a follower mentality.  It would be a much more conducive to work in an environment where people are truly team players and want to do what's best for the company and the investors.  
When WD talks about being collaborative, they just mean shut your mouth and don’t ruffle feathers.  They say they promote innovation and thinking outside of the box, but that's all lip service.  And I sometimes wonder if the people who are coming up with product ideas and functionality have ever even used similar products.  There are very basic problems in the product but no one is willing to listen and use the resources that they have right underneath their noses.  
There are too many leaders, but none willing to truly lead.  You have so many different ""leaders"" in one end to end process.  Leaders don’t get together to align their goals, resulting in very unscalable processes and frustrated employees;  you can't report on useful metrics timely because the information input at point A isn’t defined and agreed upon.  The decision that wins often is not the one that makes the most sense.  Ideas that benefit the company or are innovative are disregarded if the top people in power are against it.  People are not held accountable for their actions.  Leaders don’t enforce any sort of discipline, which you need to have at any company in order to be successful.  You have leaders who are incompetent yet they are let loose to run organizations the way they deem fit because they are friends with so and so, making things even harder to clean up as the company grows. 
There is no opportunity for promotion or growth.  They hire leaders from outside of the org that have no clue as to how things are functioning specific to WD; and to top it off, the leaders from the outside seem pretty disengaged with their own departments when they get here. 
For a company who is all about HR, you’d think relationships among their employees would be a primary concern.  The leadership here seems more concerned with making alliances with other departments to further their own position, rather than taking care of the people working hard directly under them.  I read a review here that talks about how toxic and abusive the leaders of the sales ops org are, and I can see that.  You would have to be blind not to, but once again, it's about weak leadership turning the blind eye.  I read a review that one person was shocked about the negative reviews in the sales ops org – again, this type of myopia instead of trying to understand why people are feeling this way is the exact problem.  I was once told by an employee about how this employee was being managed; I told my manager about it and was not believed."

- Great work life balance 
- Stock is doing well, good ESPP plan, stock refreshers
- Generation Workday new grad program is a good way to make friends","Workday’s App dev teams are the product engineering teams and they build the app using a propriety GUI-based language called Xpresso. The tools teams work on infrastructure and they use traditional programming languages like java and scala. This review is about app dev only.

Hate to say it but working in Xpresso is a very bad career move for engineers coming straight out of college. Unless you are proactive and work on side projects or continue to learn in your free time, you will forget your traditional coding skills. You will also not be exposed to industry-standard practices and tools by working in a proprietary stack. If you ever decide to leave, you'll likely struggle to find a traditional coding job. Workday probably has good retention rates for app devs not because app devs don't want to leave, but because they can't leave. They tell you that you’ll still learn high-level concepts like design and OOP but I don’t think it’s enough to make you a competent engineer. They also tell you that you can eventually transfer to a tools team, but it seems like you have to spend several years doing app dev first before you can switch.  Also, I think the salary for app devs is below industry average."

Impressive brand name customers
Top leadership well respected in the industry
IPO on the horizon
Chance to make a mark on a promising new company","The term ""bait and switch"" comes to mind when thinking about my experience at Workday. I was sold on the idea of joining up with a hot company that values building and grooming talent. That is the whole premise of what Workday's very own product is supposed to provide...isn't it? I was promised that there would be ample opportunities to explore different areas within the organization and grow my career. Soon after joining the team, I came to the harsh realization that was not the case. 

The leadership of the sales development team quickly proved that they make empty promises. The idea of ""talent management"" and helping employees to grow is nothing more than a feel-good slogan on the front page of the website. Employees are not treated in a respectful and adult manner, and are openly criticized in front of peers. Team morale only continues to decrease, and there is no improvement in sight."
