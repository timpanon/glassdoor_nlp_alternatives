- Work with a ton of intelligent/knowledgable people
- Schedule flexibility (dependant on team/org)","- Easy to get caught in the 'machine' and churn out thankless work for hours on end.

- Below average pay"

5,Zendesk,Awesome place to work,2022-01-28,5.0,Enterprise Account Executive,"Great product, people, and leadership without the cut-throat grind of other large software companies.",Some questionable acquisitions and a few internal processes could use revamping but otherwise not much else.
6,Zendesk,Sales,2022-02-02,4.0,Account Executive,Easy to sell product with lots of out of the box capabilities,Enjoyment from job is really based on your manager as they are allowed to treat employees anyway they deem fit. Does not seem there is much if any coaching of managers and how to be more effective.
7,Zendesk,Extremely toxic team environment,2022-02-20,1.0,Anonymous Employee,"- Some of the cross-functional colleagues were smart and motivated.
- Contributions to the neighborhood in which their headquarter was located.
- DEI efforts.","- Extremely aggressive micromanagement (director-level position). Upper management and HR were aware of this said manager's behavior, but did not show any support to the employees affected by this.

-Great product, but can be difficult to grasp all that it offers.
-Some regions need localized tech resources ASAP (i.e. LATAM, Caribbean)
-Need more resources / pricing options for our advocacy team (Zendesk Support)"

Strong compensation, RSUs and benefits package 
Awesome offices ( when they were open - stocked kitchens, catered lunches, tons of conference rooms and private space to do your work and focus)
Some of the smartest people that I've had the pleasure of working with","It happens to all companies at some point but Zendesk has gone through a major culture shift while I was there. This company never found it's identity and constantly ran before it could walk. There was never a clear -cut plan for anyone or anything. 
Employees ( that were not favored) never knew where they stood or what their future could hold at the company. When internal opportunities opened up, there was a ton of red tape and politics that employees had to navigate in order to be considered . This combined with the backdrop of the last few years made for a really bad culture."
13,Zendesk,Great place to work!,2021-11-16,5.0,SMB Account Executive,"Zendesk has been great, especially in the virtual environment. My entire tenure here has been remote and even still you can experience the great culture of Zendesk.","Tech space is crowded, as of late it seems there has been a lot of higher up colleagues that have left for other opportunities but I don't think that is unique to Zendesk by any means."

29,Zendesk,Should have left sooner...,2021-07-01,2.0,Account Executive,"- ESPP + RSU's
- Good people that became great friends
- Logo for the résumé
- Brand recognition for your sales pipeline 
- If you want to end up back in the office post COVID - this is your place to be.","Workplace:
- Toxicity in the workplace is very prevalent.

- Brand recognition turns into a con when quotas are brought into the mix. They are simply unattainable. 

- You will be expected to put your head down and don’t bring up valid issues, or you will be blacklisted.

- The sales organization is a sweatshop at this point. You will be sold a pipe dream of a role from HR but, you will quickly find out there are skeletons in each and every closet if you take the role. 

- Churn. A massive churn problem that is being swept under the rug. They have seen over 50 sales reps leave in one office within the last year. Most stemming from the toxic culture and low pay.

Management:
- Micromanagement (all departments feel this)

- Underdeveloped managers lead to micromanagement.

- Leadership is spotty at best. There are a few good eggs that you will be able to rely on and give you just enough hope.

Compensation:
- Pay is well below the market standard in SaaS. The employees in one office are taken advantage of due to the fact there are no other big logo software orgs there. 

- New reps coming in will be making well above what tenured reps make. Your annual raises are given based upon an ""internal bet"" that you will stay or leave rather based upon the revenue you bring in or experience.

- PTO policy looks decent on paper. You will not be able to take it. Want to take vacation around Christmas and New Years to spend time with family? It will be denied. No vacations are approved from December 14th - January 3rd. Christmas break with the kids - this is the wrong place. 

Career Development:
- Looking to start your career in software and grow with a company? Just know your career path will take you more than 10 years to get to a Mid Market/Commercial AE if you start as an SDR. Recommendation, find a startup with a high growth potential. You will make it to that same role in 5 years. 

Inbound SDR / Outbound SDR - 1.5yrs
Commercial BDR - 1.25 yrs
Enterprise BDR - 1.25 yrs
eSMB AE - 1.5 yrs
SMB AE - 2-3 yrs
Associate AE - 1.5-2 yrs
Commercial/Mid Market AE 

- For reference, this exact process used to be 3 steps and take 3-4 years in seat to get to Commercial/Midmarket.

Outlook:
Zendesk gave a great logo for the résumé and some lifelong friends. On the other hand, they gave more grey hair and stress to employees on the day-to-day than is healthy. I only wish I would have left sooner."

* RSUs and ESPP.

* Great office space with free food and drinks.

* Exceptional PTO policy.","* I could not recommend Zendesk as a good place to work because of the immature and inconsistent management. There's a reason why turnover on my team was high. Poor communication, lack of direction, micromanaging and an overall lack of empathy plagued my department. 

* Existing team members trained new hires on everything, without additional compensation. Enablement as a whole was pretty much non-existent.

* Pay was significantly lower than industry standard.

57,Zendesk,Could not be happier... to have moved on,2021-02-10,2.0,Account Executive,"For the most part, good benefits and you will have all of the tech resources you need to do your job. A great entry into the service and SaaS world and an impressive resume builder. 

They do a great job recruiting and hiring intelligent and fun individuals and if you want an in-office job they will be returning in some form post covid. 

As an SDR and AE you have the name recognition and a fairly steady flow of inbound leads & you’re able to work and close expansions.","Of course there were fun times like happy hours and team events, but overall the sales organization at Zendesk was honestly exhausting and toxic. Someone shared this with me and it 100% sums up my experience at Zendesk, “I thought I was at a company with a great culture until I left and realized I was just at a place where I worked with my friends” 

When I started, people genuinely loved their jobs and had a work life balance - that was not the case for me or many of my colleagues. To highlight a few reasons:
- Culture fell to the wayside, and while there were some added benefits for your wellbeing during covid, it was a band aid approach.
- While there are 20 PTO and 10 sick days, most sales reps could not take all or even a majority of them because of high quotas. 
- If there was a “fair” quota, it did not exist for long and sales reps were treated as machines to pump out their number. 
- Salaries are below market standards with little to no room to negotiate during internal promotions. 
- This past year there were widespread examples of new reps with less experience (external and internal) with higher salaries than tenured reps. When it was brought up to management, reps were shamed for sharing salaries. 
- If you are hired into a new role or there is a major change to the department, forget your work life balance - hello overtime, stress & burnout! 

The level of micromanagement and lack of trust was outstanding. Management’s focus was rarely on what worked well for the individual rep and only on how to keep everyone “in check”. Certain managers discouraged or even prohibited reps from leaving their desk to work in soft spaces around the office, from booking rooms to have meetings/make calls in, or pre-covid from having the flexibility to work from home. 

There were a few managers that were truly great but they were the exception and oftentimes had to stick their neck out on behalf of their team. 

Another extremely frustrating part of Zendesk was the career progression. 
- The ability to transition to other departments was advertised and encouraged during the interview process, but that was not the case. 
- There was a lack of consistency with internal promotions and of the requirements to be considered. 
- Promotion requirements went from a holistic approach on brand, contribution, activity, and attainment, to an added tenure requirement, and ended where the main focus was on quota attainment. 
- Even during a pandemic, internal reps who came close on attainment were not considered, despite consistently high activities and who were qualified on all other fronts.

I was honestly lucky with my experience of promotions, but I witnessed many talented and exceptional peers screwed over, and ultimately it all came down to internal politics and favoritism. 

If you can put your head down and be a compliant worker who shows up, does not speak in opposition, and can ignore everything except what absolutely infuriates you, then you will do fine in the sales org at Zendesk. 

If you want to feel like you're making an impact and thrive in a collaborative, feedback welcomed culture, you'll probably be disappointed. 

I’m grateful for my experience and the friends I’ve made, but unfortunately for Zendesk, no one I’ve spoken with has regretted leaving, their only regret was thinking something would change and waiting it out as long as they did."

Individuals who ask questions, challenge the status quo, and do not believe in doing things the way they’ve always been done simply because that’s the way they’ve always been done are thought of as trouble makers, difficult and “not a culture fit”. If you can, however, nod and smile and just say “yes” you will be welcomed here and promoted accordingly. This permeates from the top throughout the organization."

Most hires come from outside of the company rather than hiring within. 

The company has not given raises to lower level employees in 2 or 3 years. They just announced a half baked bonus programs that rewards VPs and Directors more than the lower level employees who are doing the work and not receiving raises.

The company is unfortunately still on a pattern of hiring friends and keeping them in positions they are unfit for - this continues to be the demise of the Marketing organization here."

124,Zendesk,Constant Change with one goal: more success,2020-02-09,5.0,Sales Executive,"Zendesk continues to be in a 'high growth phase' and has been for years. This gives the company a chance to create new processes, roles, teams, targets, and expectations. The company promotes from within and gives employees the opportunity to jump into jobs they may not have been qualified for outside of Zendesk. The company has incredibly high expectations for each person and the sales quotas are a clear reflection of this.

The team dynamics and friendly competition is one of the top reasons people can be happy here. Upper Management/Directors encourage you to work together with an incredible amount of autonomy - find out what works and what doesn't. If it doesn't, change it and start over.","Zendesk isn't the same company the founders claimed to have started. It's not an easy-going, laid back, play ping-pong during the day and nap on your break type of organization. It's an organization that is changing so often the team rarely has time to settle into the new changes. 

The amount of change is unlike anything I could have imagined. I am not sure we ever truly let a plan play out and calculate results before implementing something else. Exciting? Yes. Stressful? Yes.
 
We run a lean team and rely on everyone to step up. It's hard to hide when sales, support, ops, all need everyone on board and working 100%."
125,Zendesk,Great Place to work and amazing people to work with,2020-02-19,5.0,Trainer,"Zendesk employees from Associate to C-Staff are humble and approachable.  People are always open to talk with you or have a meeting with you regardless of your title.

In my experience, Managers love to help you grow and promote even if it's to another team internally.  

Finally, I feel supported by my team, my manager(s), and the company in my personal development and career growth.

Highly recommend working here!","There are some growing pains as the company moves into solidifying a stance as an Enterprise business serving all types of businesses.  This honestly isn't a ""con"" since this would be true for any company growing from Startup, to SMB, to Enterprise, to all-encompassing. So, this isn't a con per se. Just know there are some growing pains with processes or goals, but nothing to detour you from working here! :)"
126,Zendesk,Leadership cares more about the needle than you.,2020-01-31,2.0,SMB Account Executive,"A couple of years ago, I would have recommended Zendesk to anyone who wanted to work here. The culture was great, the morale was high, and leadership appeared to be invested in your professional development and growth.","After working as an SDR/BDR and then trying to change career paths, I was stonewalled by the director of the organization, who made it impossible for me to transition internally. After talking to co-workers, I realized that my experience was not unique. 

As I've reluctantly continued my career in sales at Zendesk, they have pushed back against negotiating salary, continuously increased quotas to nearly unobtainable and certainly unrealistic levels, and stripped away opportunities for bonus incentives. As more and more leadership comes on from larger organizations (Oracle, Salesforce, Amazon), the culture at Zendesk is being squandered at an attempt to drive revenue at an unrealistic pace. You can see the sales team and their managers experiencing a crisis, the blood beginning to boil as leadership strips pay away, and tenured reps leaving for the competition. The actions taken by this organization as of late do not bode well for employee retention."
127,Zendesk,There's a lot of work to do to change to an Enterprise focused organization,2019-12-05,5.0,Account Executive,"The people are the reason I loved Zendesk so much. Everyone was willing to help one another and looking to grow and be better. They had an incredibly flexible PTO policy which made work-life balance better than any other company I've worked for. I find my friends saying ""you'll never find another place like Zendesk"" and I believe that to be true. I felt it was a relatively easy life there. I felt challenged but at the same time it was an easy product to understand and to sell.","Their goal as an organization is to move into the Enterprise. Unfortunately their focus is still incredibly transactional which is how Zendesk grew so quickly. This transactional foundation is a huge detriment to the goal of moving into the Enterprise because much of the leadership team is influenced by the people who've grown up within the organization and therefore drive the process from the ground up. Almost all reps still speak regularly at the practitioner level and the conversations are not value driven. I believe Zendesk has been so successful thus far because the product is great and easy to use. 

My goal in being there was to progress my sales career to work more complex and Enterprise/Strategic deals. While they certainly have some great Enterprise Logos, the footprint of those organizations is still relatively small. Zendesk does not focus on the outcomes that companies are trying to achieve in choosing their solution and because of this, sales reps are consistently delegated down to low level contacts. I left Zendesk because the culture had changed significantly. The leadership team has gotten incredibly political and there is clear favoritism throughout the organization. In addition, there are a few people who because of their political ties, basically run the organization and if you have a misstep with them, it can cost you your job and reputation which is unfortunate. This means you have to be very careful about who you trust there and the information you share."
128,Zendesk,A great company impacted by sub-par managers,2020-01-09,3.0,Sales,"The company started out on a great premise - providing beautifully simple solutions for customer support, and the product is great overall. There are good people working at Zendesk who care about the company, and about each other.","The company can be very clique-y, and there are certain ""untouchables"" who keep retaining their jobs even though their work has been sub-par. There are others who seem to have an extraordinary amount of influence on decisions, and you live or die by their word. Management in my part of the company was severely lacking at several levels, and I heard similar from associated teams."

This is not a safe place to work. My family refuses to come down to visit, for fear of getting accosted.

A long time leader in the customer support Gartner report.,"I waited until I had been here at least a year as I’ve seen tech companies that evolve and change as they go through growth stages and growing pains. The Zendesk company I joined a year ago is very different than the current iteration of Zendesk. I was heavily recruited for a position that has of late been de-valued for no real reason or probably more likely they would like to see done by a younger cheaper resource. Favoritisms is a real thing here and some managers have been known to favor their younger employees. On the other hand, the older seniors managers are generally former executives from org’s like Oracle, SAP, SFDC, some AWS etc that are bringing their companies ideas to Zendesk as they struggle to serve the Enterprise market. That is not Zendesk’s roots and the company is going through a painful identity crisis as a result. I heard an expression from a former executive that was readying a massive reorganization that said “everyone wants to go to Heaven but no one wants to die”. Yeah, right now it’s kinda like that. Some big changes are coming and it’s going to be interesting to see how the company emerges. Your mileage will definitely vary here at this time."

It has grown a lot, but still has a great culture.","I would not recommend working in the People Ops team. Things were great until more recently. New leadership was brought in that never worked at a company of our size, and is trying to make it corporate and ""operationalize"" everything. You can't automate every process, and the focus has changed from taking care of all employees to only management at the top and whatever their pain points are. There has been massive turnover in every team under People & Places and they are continuing to lose good people. Every week I hear of another friend who is leaving or getting ready to leave. Nothing is being done to try to keep people, they just replace them and hope the new person stays around longer. They tell a story that people are leaving because they have better opportunities, but people are just unhappy and leaving for the same job somewhere else, or leaving without even having a job lined up."

HR protects the company: Bring up issues about your manager and they'll either forward them to the manager themselves or ignore them. Usually they did the former.

Managers have total power: If your manager doesn't like you, you're not going to last at the company. They have total discretion to determine who gets to do what, and will assign you no work, then criticize you for doing no work.

The environment is generally collaborative without a lot of bureaucracy getting in the way of new ideas. Most employees are approachable and transparent and genuinely want to help each other succeed. 

I love our global structure because I get to work and exchange ideas with coworkers all over the world and sometimes travel to collaborate in person. These connections across cultures have contributed greatly to my professional and personal growth. 

Our benefits are excellent and our office spaces are beautiful and well taken care of. Learning & development is promoted on an individual and team level. Our events and holiday parties are really fun without being ostentatious.

I have amazing work/life balance; It's a real value here, not just lip service. I work 45 hours per week on average and my productivity is higher than jobs where I worked 60+ because I love what I do.","Working in the Tenderloin is very stressful. As some employees have mentioned, voicing that you don't like coming here every day is dismissed by many as an insult to our neighbors. I reject that leap; I care a lot about the people who live here and I volunteer with and donate to local organizations. I also avoid coming into work because I do not feel safe. I've personally been grabbed by a stranger, stepped on used needles, heard gunshots, and seen several acts of violence- all within a few feet of our offices.

-Decent work life balance.
-MOST high level employees will recognize your hard work.
-For the most part great people to work with. 
-Not too big of a company but not too small. Good work environment.
-Always growing and leadership is transparent with information.
-They listen to employees and try to do better for the most part.","Neighborhood is very interesting to say the least. I understand there is a $120 parking benefit for Zendesk and I appreciate that. However, the Tenderloin is probably not the best place for a growing company. This is something employees cannot control and I know it is a huge negative about Zendesk. There is no way to sugar coat this. 

Many employees that were here in the early stages of Zendesk are gone or pushed out. (Talking about employees that started before 2016).   In order to survive at Zendesk, favoritism was something you better hope your management has for you.  There was a recent hire where a  Sr director decided to just build a team with people who use to work for her. This ultimately created a separation from the longer tenured employees and a huge level of favoritism.

The level of favoritism at Zendesk made it hard for my team to stay motivated and work harder. In my opinion, this has to be addressed. I understand there are people you prefer to work with, but it got to a point where if you didn't agree with the direction the team is heading towards. You will be placed in their cross hairs. I also understand change is something that is hard to adapt to. However, if employees in your team are unhappy and leaving one by one. I don't have much to say. That in itself is a red flag."

186,Zendesk,"Company Not ""Buttoned Up"" and Struggling with its 2nd Act!",2017-10-10,2.0,Anonymous Employee,"People are friendly and there is a strong, almost familial culture.  In that vein there is a strong respect for  family and work life balance relative to other tech companies in the bay area.  While it varies by group working hours in the office typically start at between 9-10am. And most people leave between 5-6pm so there are very few folks around past 6:00pm. Compensation is generally lower than at other tech firms. But it is probably fair given the number of hours worked.","CHALLENGES MOVING UP MARKET
The company is going through a challenging transition as it moves from its early success being a help desk software platform for startups and smaller businesses to one that is now focused on moving up market and selling customer service software to larger more established businesses. Zendesk has promised Wall Street that it will achieve $1B in revenue by 2020. This is an aggressive goal that has put a lot of short term stress on the business (and correspondingly its employees) each quarter as it figures out how to live up to the promise.

To achieve $1B in my mind means fully committing to moving up market and selling to enterprise buyers. This has been hard for the company as it is requires the company to be the type of business that the original Zendesk was trying to disrupt. As Mikkel the CEO writes in his book Startupland ""we shared a healthy disdain for the traditional enterprise software sales model. The big platforms, the expensive salespeople with the expense accounts, the semireligious conferences, the PowerPoint software, the locked-in relationships"".

This move up market requires that requires the company to change a lot of what made it successful early on. The company needs to build new muscles in sales and marketing to support enterprise  which requires new skills, new processes, and often times new people.  This has resulted in multiple reorganizations (or ""evolutions"" as they are now calling them) in sales and marketing that have been fairly disruptive and caused a lot of angst for people in terms of having clear roles and responsibilities.

LACK OF URGENCY
The work life balance mentioned as a pro also means that the company does not move as quickly as other places. And as a result there is not a lot of ""urgency"" within the company to get stuff done quickly. This can be frustrating for those who do have urgency and are trying to push others to have the same mindset.

NOT A DATA/ANALYTICS CULTURE
The company has historically not been one that relied significantly on data/metrics to make decisions. It's always done things by the seat of its pants and is not particularly buttoned up.  As a result there is not a strong data/analytics culture within the company and the corresponding data/analytics infrastructure including reporting and systems reflects that.  So often the data required to make decisions is not available, incomplete, or simply inaccurate.
The company is trying to change this but it requires a lot of work to undo years of neglect. So for folks that want to have reliable data to make decisions Zendesk may not be the best fit.

DIVERSITY & CAREER ADVANCEMENT
While the company has initiatives around diversity the company is still not very diverse at the senior and mid level management positions and there seems to be a bias for younger employees. This seems to be ingrained into the companies recruiting culture. In fact two of its most senior and long tenured minority Vice Presidents just announced their departure October 2017. The company does have a history of promoting young employees who are willing to work hard and go the extra mile. There are at least 3 VPs that have been promoted in the last year that are under 30. Many of the older senior leaders are being pushed out."

--Everyone was focused, well-intentioned, earnest, smart.
--Pervasive sense of belonging.  The CEO's spirit sort of hangs over the place and this is mostly a good thing.
--Management is very self-aware, and has good judgment especially with regard to fostering a good employee experience and marketing.","--Roles were not always well-defined, especially in Ops.  Probably some cultural vestiges left over from the startup days.
--Zendesk is lacking ( a bit) in technical talent from top to bottom.  Its a Ruby-on-Rails shop at heart, trying to move into big data, machine learning, and more.  But could any c-level exec (besides Mikkel) even log on to a server?
--The company is almost comically non-aggressive.  Bold projects or risk-taking technologies are not emphasized as much as donating time to take an elderly resident on a bike ride through the Tenderloin (then capturing 50 photos for social media).

- Nice office and event space that exhibits Danish design elements 
- Great weekly happy hours, lunch & learn sessions.","- Culture: There is no common DNA that binds the company culturally. The company has to emphasize on core values and have people in all levels of the organization “walk the walk”. 
- Rampant cronyism/favoritism. If you are friends with the Sheriff, you can get away with anything in this town. 
- ""Flash"" gets rewarded over substance
- Lack of transparency in senior leadership. Financial and headcount planning exercise lacks discipline and long term thinking. 
- Engineering is treated as a disposable “resource” and full time employees get treated more like contractors. 
- Product management dictates what gets done without necessarily doing due diligence. Most things are done by a product manager’s “gut” feel without the corresponding responsibility. Non-technical PMs trying to run engineering teams makes things double worse. 
- The operations engineering organization is an absolute nightmare. Things take forever to get done and any efforts to fix this has not been effective. 
- The company lacks long term strategic thinking and tends to follow industry leaders without being thought leaders. 
- There has been a lot of attrition in the company in the past six months. There have been at least 10 people at the senior management level (VP+) who have left the company along with several tenured employees.

• No follow-up or accountability on negative performance reviews, if they're one of the 'cool kids' - particularly, if they the 'cool kid' is in management 
• High turnover and some aloof, ineffective managers that leave their team in disarray
• High turnover has encouraged sloppy hiring of people who name-drop and speak only in industry buzzwords with little comprehension or deep technical ability; narcissists are superb at charisma and conning, working their way up the social ladder
• Younger arrogant managers talking down to seasoned engineers and colleagues causing friction and lack of trust between teams and employees
• Huge attrition rates and technical debt with loss of great colleagues, now that we've gone public (IPO)
• Non-comparable pay for Silicon Valley, despite experience level and ability; high pay goes to the 'cool kids' with the 'flashy outfits' and ""friends"" in high places

Enthusiastic staff - while workloads can be daunting, getting things done correctly is first and foremost on everyone's mind.  The overall vibe is very team-centric.

Onboarding is a snap - I've had everything necessary to do my job since my first day in the office.  This includes hardware (workstation and peripherals), software (operational applications, task-specific applications), security (right-sized access to data/tools) and mentoring (vast team knowledge and a role-related ""buddy"" to answer any questions).  New hires need to get up to speed quickly, and this enables it.

Freedom to work where you are comfortable.  Prefer a booth or a couch over sitting at your desk?  No problem - there are plenty of different types of spots to settle in to get work done.  Use of technology to meet also bridges communication gaps that are typically present in companies with teams that are literally based around the world.

Reduced overhead.  Need a mouse?  Get one.  There's no need for a 5-day turnaround with requisitioning something that'd cost less than the time it would take to request it.  Employees are enabled to make decisions and get things done that are in the best interest of the organization.","There is much work to be done - if you aren't accustomed to a fast-paced, constantly-changing environment, this can be exasperating.  Fortunately, management has acknowledged this is and is in the process of right-sizing the organization for the workload.

Some people may be challenged by the open-concept office layout - if you come from a land of white noise and cubicle farms, there are plenty of audio and visual distractions to deal with.

If you're willing to hustle, growth opportunities are definitely available.
Some of the leaders (product, CFO, CIO, CEO) are really strong. As good as I've ever worked with/for. 
The product is great, and the customers are really engaged.
People Operations (HR) is a fabulous team, easy to work with and have improved a lot of things for employees in the recent past.","Counter to the first point, a lot of amazing people have been leaving recently. 
There is a culture of opacity that's not great. 
The new(ish) CRO is fast and furious with changes. There's been significant disruption in Sales, Marketing, and Customer Support. Some of it good, some of it very bad. 
Would recommend careers in product, creative, engineering. There are other departments I'd recommend staying away from for a bit."

- Great products and a focus on innovation to make sure we're always improving them. 

-Leadership is willing to admit when something isn't going as well as it could be and course-correct. Double-edged sword, of course. 

- Incredible focus on corporate social responsibility all over the globe 

- Very flat organization where management is receptive to new ideas and methods","-Career progression opportunities are ill-defined and opaque in many departments. 

- Not necessarily a con for everyone but rapid growth means you might be doing one thing one day and then told to stop doing it and focus on something else the next. To the point that people have been hired to do a job only for it to turn into a pretty different role entirely. If you're flexible and interested in learning new things, this can be a pro.

Clearly defined roles within the team at varying levels, including specific information about what is expected to be promoted within the same type of role or how to move to a different role. 

Everyone is passionate about Zendesk and is honest about our strengths & areas for improvement -- there aren't any facades here. 

I thoroughly enjoy our company town hall meetings. Mikkel's personality truly shines and is reflected in all of my peers.

Beautiful office space with all of the conveniences and luxuries you could dream of. 

An international presence gives you the opportunity to work with others abroad and gain exposure to business practices outside of the US.

I like my co-workers, but do not feel pressured to be ""best friends"" with them as might be present in other similar environments. We're all mature and respect our space.","There is a significant amount of work required due to the aggressive goals, therefore, causing everyone to be stretched thin at times.

* Employee stock ownership gives all of the employees a vested interest in performing and doing well
* ESPP and stock bonuses make for good compensation even though there is no 401k matching
* Lots of promotions being announced, so I'm assuming there is upwards mobility (full transparency, I've only been here 1 month)","* Some minor growing pains and technical debt (to be expected as we transition from a small startup to a larger publicly traded company)

We use our own product to serve our customers which allows us to spot bugs, provide advice from our own experiences, and provide feedback to Product and Project Managers to help make Zendesk better. Many Support teams, you just punch your card and answer the phone all day, but Zendesk is quite different.

Zendesk as a company is very focused on community initiatives, giving us a plethora of opportunities to volunteer in our neighborhoods.

Finally, the culture. I look forward to going to work (even on Mondays). It's amazing to look forward to seeing your coworkers and how much everyone truly appreciates the value of helping one another get the best answer to customers.","Direct, constructive feedback is sometimes hard to come by, especially if you excel in your role.

In an individual contributor role, my primary interactions are with our customers, our sales team, and our product team, all of which are fantastic to work with. Culture and work/life balance are super important and valued highly.   In a company where the founders are still an integral part of day-to-day after 9 years, the trust in the C-level team is incredibly high.","VP level leadership has taken some significant mis-steps, causing pain for those under them, but on the whole have made positive contributions.

- The company has turned into a sales driven company instead of engineering first company, which is very normal to see in a big enterprise world. Unfortunately this is a very tough and uncomfortable situation especially in the engineering organization

They are all super-smart, interesting, and some don't come from a typical IT background. They can be very passionate and opinionated but having come from some places where people don't really care about their work or their customers, I would definitely rather be surrounded by people who care too much than not enough. The teamwork and collaboration is really great also. 

As is common with small technology companies, they are constantly changing so that they can try new things and adapt to what is needed.","If you don't like a fast paced atmosphere with constant change, this company is not for you. 

It can sometimes seem like it's disorganized, and it's getting so big that communication between departments can be challenging.

They strongly believe in a culture that treats people like real human beings instead of just a cog in the machine and they back up that belief by spending money on it. I feel valued and respected for what I bring to the table. The corporate growth strategy seems to make sense.","The company is growing rapidly. That means that change is a constant. Change can be tough to deal with and not everyone deals with it in a healthy way.

Minus some of the comments in the 'Cons' section, there are a lot of good and smart people there. The creative team, support team, HR, C-Level executives, and others but these stand out. 

If you want to brand your company, look at what Zendesk has done over the years, they are MASTERS!

The product - is AMAZING and they just keep making it better! 

Company is still growing and is a company to watch!","As the company started to grow, they were hiring leaders from big companies but having the best and with the proper experience come on board. Thus, caused issues with learning curves and new challenges that should have not been there if they hired more qualified mid-level leaders. These leaders then in turn brought in weaker people and thus crating a poor working environment.

The different groups have very strong clicks that will alienate new people and other that are no in their own department. Some of the people, especially in marketing and sales, are straight out rude and seem not to have very high moral value.  

Pricing of the product is always a topic for people looking to use Zendesk and I know many companies now that want to use Zendesk but don't because of the pricing and go with another system. These are enterprise level companies too."

Zendesk worked hard to maintain a balanced work-hard play-hard culture.  The founders brought a great Euro vibe which was a welcome change from the more typical and more aggressive Silicon Valley/tech culture.","Some could argue that the rapid growth of the company was very fun and exciting, but as one who likes the ability to get to know the people I work with and amongst, growing that fast makes it hard to feel like you're part of a family."
260,Zendesk,Proud Zendeskian,2016-03-17,5.0,,"Zendesk is a very rare company to work for in the sense that is rapidly approaching being a true ""grown-up"" enterprise software with arguably the best product of it's type in the market, yet they remain true to the culture that got them where they are today. 

People first, or more accurately the right people first: meaning that doing whats best for the customer/employee/community takes precedent over doing what will benefit the share-holders. The idea here that by doing the right thing, in as many aspects as possible, the company will benefit as a byproduct. Not only is this an idea that resonates with me personally, with today's increasingly socially-minded consumers, it will likely continue to resonate with the market.

I know I am not alone in saying, that ""Zendesk Family"" (this includes our customers too!) feel less like job/business and more of a culture or a literal family, and on that you would willingly try your best to see do well.

Plenty of opportunity. Plenty of truly good people. Couldn't be happier building my career here","When I started there, it was like a person in that awkward ""transition period"" before being able act, and feel, like an adult. Almost like the freshman sports star that realized the talent alone that got them there would not be enough to keep having the success they have grown to expect. It would take being smarter. Better processes. More leadership.

While I have seen a dramatic (it's crazy really) improvement in this regard, they know that improvements can always be made. 

Because of this, if you are not good at adapting to an ever-changing environment, or willing to try something new, possibly just to scrap it just as you started getting used to doing so, you may not like Zendesk."

If you work in a smaller office or as a remote employee, then you miss out on a lot. 

Some less experienced leaders think that what worked for the company while in scrappy start-up mode will continue to work for this public company with over 1200 employees, and they undermine the work senior leaders are doing to take Zendesk to the next level.

Company is on a crazy good trajectory, has the right energy behind the managing team, and the quality of people needed to make it happen. Massive confidence in success, mobility, and happiness here.",Startupy feel can have cons - there is some lack of process or system clarity internally. Tons of dogfooding and Silicon Valley jargon - be ready for some acronyms and use of the ZD products (up to you if that is a con)

Division between old and new employees, unwarranted promotions, and a general undercurrent of management and communications through fear and intimidation. Blame-centric culture where workloads are not balanced, and lack of support to succeed."

I have not come across anyone just putting in time, or out for personal glory.  We all have each other's backs.  The whole company is founded on Scandinavian humility, and though we're proud of the work we do, there's no bro-ish attitude - that doesn't get in the door.","The neighborhood is not the best, to put it mildly - mid-Market.

Recruiting was incredibly responsive, knowledgable, and courteous throughout the process.

- Free food! 
- Cocktails on a Friday
- Treats at Christmas and Easter
- Really great group of people. Everyone is really friendly and helpful.","- The sales management team are inexperienced, pretty inefficient and at times unprofessional.
- Sales training is weak during on-boarding and non-existent for existing staff
- The commission was excellent but its been chipped away. Despite local pressure to hit targets it has been said that ""if people hit targets then it means the targets are incorrect"". The basic salary is low and so with the commission plan being reduced this makes the pay uncompetitive.
- Few career opportunities for management in London - opportunities coming up in Dublin."

-Young workforce that hasn't had a lot of experience outside of Zendesk.   Think that if they don't get a promotion that the company is wrong or broken.  We do a great job of promoting form within, but it has definitely created a culture of entitlement in some departments."
281,Zendesk,I like Zendesk,2015-08-03,5.0,,Zendesk has a great work environment. I love the people here. The perks are great and it's a fun job.,There are lots of behind-the-scene politics that you may become aware of a few months of employment. Some departments here are compensated less fairly than others.
282,Zendesk,Not a startup,2015-09-09,3.0,Product Designer,"It's a big company by now, so a lot of processes are well in place, from on boarding to structure.","It's a big company, it doesn't really have the startup feel anymore, even though they like to state that they do. A lot of bureaucracy, too many meetings."
283,Zendesk,"Great Company, experience depends on your team",2015-09-09,4.0,Anonymous Employee,"Great CEO and founders, great product",some teams are isolated and not transparent; others are more interesting and rewarding to work in
284,Zendesk,There are good times and there are bad times.,2015-08-13,3.0,Support Advocate,"-I can't stress how amazing the people you work with are. They're fantastic people who you celebrate the best times with, and drink away the worst of times with.

-The office is a fantastic space with gorgeous views. The in-office perks are pretty fantastic

-As long as you're doing your job, you can pretty much coast by and do a so-so job and still get somewhere in the company (get a raise/promoted/bonus).

-It's a relatively young office; so co-workers are always open to getting drinks after work.","Where do I start:
-There is not a standard set of expectations for employees company-wide. Employees who work in larger departments need to work harder to shine; while those in smaller departments who are absolutely terrible at their job can either get promoted/raises/bonuses pretty easily.

-Employees can do a terribly at their job, and still get promoted due to a lack of applicants/talent for jobs. The same can be said for people in their position a prolonged period of time. I'm not saying this is the case for all employees, but it really degrades the title of your position. My advice to anyone going into support is to do your time, get to know the hiring managers in other departments, tailor your time in support to where you want to end up, and get out of support as soon as you can.

-There is no pay scale implemented at all. Team leads can sometimes make less than those on their teams; there no standardization when it comes to pay. There can be an alarming gap between employees who hold the same title. Some employees with a job title that is in a tier below another can make the same, if not more than an employee in a higher tier of the same department. You're better off not telling anyone what you make, or asking what others make (because good luck getting that pay bump).  

-There's definitely a considerable amount of politicking that goes on in the background, and it doesn't help the employees at all. The company could use a little more transparency rather than sugar-coating unpleasant news. 

-It's a relatively young office; so some questionable decisions are bound to be made."
285,Zendesk,Great company!,2015-07-17,5.0,Sales,"Great benefits, perks, health options, and fully stocked kitchen. The culture is great, and it's nice to know that you can be yourself here","I believe the managers should go through a training before becoming a manager.

People seem to be vested in the well-being of the company and everyone is interested in what's new with the product. There are also some great perks and benefits, like stock options, snacks, happy hours, etc. There's also wonderful opportunities for volunteering and community engagement.

Overall, Zendesk has the vibe and benefits of a startup, but without the risk that you might not get paid the next week.",Most companies of this size have matching 401k. The health insurance contribution amounts could be better. I would also like a better idea of what my career path is in terms of advancement within the company.
288,Zendesk,Overview,2015-06-10,5.0,Sales Development Representative,"The culture is welcoming and authentic. The people are odd, but everyone acts like themselves and they have fun doing it.
Each manager seems to have the employees best interest in mind. They focus on your career success and the company values contribution.
There is not a feeling of entitlement and some people are managers, some people are important, some people are staff, some people are simple employees, some people are the founders, but you would never know if you spent a day in the office. Everyone is focused on what's best for the organization.",Zendesk is growing faster than the company can predict. Often growing pains associated with the constant expansion.

293,Zendesk,Bad HR. Inexperienced managers.  Good luck.,2015-03-01,2.0,Anonymous Employee,There are some genuinely talented people at Zendesk who are passionate about their jobs and their industry. If you manage to find yourself in a department with those people - and you are one of those people yourself - you may count yourself truly lucky.,"HR - literally has *no* clue what it's doing. Bad recruiting, poor response to internal complaints, can't figure out how to deal with payroll or how to scope a new HR system.  They also have no idea how to provide a career path for people or advice to management on how to help with that.  They are, quite simply, the worst.
Management - inexperienced and doesn't seem to recognize the value of experience.  Upper management would rather surround itself with ""cool"" than with people with actual knowledge. Middle management tends to follow suit. 

In attempting to build the market for Zendesk over the past several years, the company culture has become broken and the product itself bloated. The core company values are seemingly forgotten in the rush to sell."

The culture is refreshing, the office space is beautiful, and the management is transparent from the top down. The employees are incredibly smart but no one takes themselves too seriously. There are many ""perks"" at other companies and Ive made more money elsewhere but Zendesk is a place of motivated, smart, fun and easy going people.","Lets be honest, the neighborhood is not the best in San Francisco but Zendesk is committed to making a positive impact in the community which we work."
295,Zendesk,Horrible Fraternity!!,2015-02-20,1.0,,"Free food, weekly happy hour and that;s it!!","Bad company culture, characterized by Fear, Intimidation and Cronyism. No one laughs, smiles or is cordial in passing. Open workspace and I swear you can hear a pin drop.. no casual chit chat.  It just seems weird. A happy workplace should hum. Some people should be up, moving around, and talking to one another. They should not seem bored or stressed. Just an overall weird vibe from this place. Would not recommend unless you like working with people who have ice water running through their veins."

- CEO is really cool, enjoys a drink with his coworkers/employees
- Decent chance to get at least one promotion at some point","- Getting a decent raise or bonus without changing positions is effectively impossible
- The compensation structure is a complete mess, and management doesn't seem to care; HR makes all the decisions & Sales/Development get all the money
- The recruiting process - from first call to hire - is slow, painful, and frequently all-around rough
- Too many broken promises for perks, wage increases, etc.
- Some departments are still very understaffed; other departments frequently ask understaffed depts to help with projects and they don't have time for it
- Some people are promoted because management doesn't have any other way to give them a salary increase"
