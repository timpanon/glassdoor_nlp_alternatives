CEO is great and have met him on numerous occasions even with over 60k employees!","Definitely harder for new agents. Limited lead opportunities (there is one app they offer but it's extremely overpopulated at this point), so you're kind of on your own for clients unless you join a paid team."

7,eXp Realty,EXP REALTY truly is the best brokerage,2022-04-02,5.0,Real Estate Agent,The training is better than any other brokerage in my opinion. They have revenue sharing which is better than profit sharing. Your “team/Group” does not have to be Limited to the state that you are in. Let’s not forget about the stock and health insurance. And as long as your signs/advertisement passes the legal requirements you are not obligated to brand the company you have the freedom to brand yourself.,Just like any small business you are responsible for expenses. some of the “resources” offered by Exp realty is at a considerable discount than getting it on your own.

I've been here since Aug and every quarter they have done something to benefit staff. Bonuses, upgraded benefits, across the board cost of living increases (in addition to merit increases), etc. At this point, I wouldn't be surprised if the next announcement was that we are all getting a car LOL. I've been around for a while and this is by far the best company I have ever worked for.

The pay is great and the stock share is great! There are multiple revenue streams available to earn a lot of money.","For real estate agents, this may not be the best choice for brand new licensees just starting out. I say this only because most agents have no idea where to begin after you pass your state exam. Sometimes newbies need to have the physical one on one interaction for training and learning the ropes. This does not mean that a new agent cannot succeed here because there's a lot of them that have. You just have to stay motivated and ENGAGE in as much as you can."

Upper management are accessible. From your state broker all the way to the Glenn Sanford at the top. Glenn often interacts in the online platforms which is is great. You never have to wonder if your thoughts about something are heard or not because he's right in there in on the platform with everyone else.","The hate from agents at other brokerages. They love to hate on eXp on social media and give out info about eXp that often times is flat out wrong. If you're considering eXp, but the haters have you second guessing stop and consider their motive and where that hate is coming from. I'll give you a hint. They don't really understand the company and they fear eXp's success will negatively impact their bottom line. Instead of making their company better the only thing left to do is try hard to make the other guy (eXp) look bad. It's very reminiscent of middle school. To the haters...rise above or come aboard! Just do better. Either way, it's not too late."

Brick and stick brokerages are a thing of the past, noone goes to those offices anymore, everything is on the internet. Stock rewards for your individual accomplishments are so rewarding and the sponsorship of others into the company gives even more rewards on a continual basis as long as that agent is productive!

The support system within management creates an excellent example for the rest of the team. There is never a moment where you feel like you cannot ask someone for assistance. The overall tenor of dialogue from management is always positive and keeps the team's best interest in mind. I cannot praise eXp Realty enough for being so dynamic and progressive in their business and HR strategy. Other companies should take note and follow eXp's lead.,Any con that one could think of will immediately be cancelled out by one of their many perks!

The stock is great too as long as you understand short term volatility is high and beleive in the long term, I have made a lot of money with the stock. Our state brokerage is great too extremely responsive and helpful.",as a first year solo agent you don't have as much struture as you probably need.

So called""leads"" who turn into cliques if you know more about real estate than they do and they will intentionally try to get you fired. Managers will not listen to compliance, they listen to the leads and basically call anyone else a liar. Staff meetings no one asks questions, there is nothing remotely collaborative and discussions are considered arguments if you have any knowledge about real estate at all. You do not get praise at all even if you set all time records and are amazing but you constantly get slapped in the face for minor mistakes. DO NOT TAKE THE SURVEYS AND TELL THE TRUTH!!! They say meetings are confidential but do not fall for it. Management needs an overhaul with people who actually know real estate and a compliance specialists does not just obtain their license. Bad outlook for such an innovative company and it all ends with hiring managers and not leaders."

Mentors vary highly in quality, seemingly due to sponsorship incentives."
451,eXp Realty,Good company,2021-08-02,5.0,Realtor,Quick turnaround for questions and help. Tons of training online. Weekly state and region meetings keep agents well informed and on top of issues and legal changes. Good sharing of info among agents at these meetings.,High turnover of BICs in my region. A few ongoing online training meetings were live and difficult to attend-- i.e. 6 pm meeting start on US West coast means 9 pm meeting start on East coast. Didn't like having a weekly meeting that started that late.

Great company to work for if you want to be a robot with low pay
Wonderful place to work for if you want to be a submissive yes man/woman
If you are a physically “good looking”, female, you will get invited to company events even if they have nothing to do with your department! 
If you like constant re-organization, new bosses, new policies and procedures (or lack there of) and constantly changing job duties, this is the place for you.","The corporate politics is beyond out of control. The mind games and feeling like a pawn in a game of chess in a losing game can really mess with your head.  
When you need help and it takes 6 months to hire one person because the “President” has absolutely no authority, there is an issue. 
No purchase plan for employees 
The company is “agent success obsessed” but forgets that the corporate staff needs to be supported and could take a lesson in focusing on the employees success also. 
The low pay because employees work remote is not going to fly much longer. 
This company is not for the forward thinking person, unless you are in upper management. For those not in management, you are a robot doing what you are told and has better have a smile doing it."

- Revenue Sharing (much better than Profit Sharing)
- Equity (we are shareholders in the company! Discount stock can be purchased with every transaction)
- Cloud-based brokerage, meaning fully remote, paperless transactions, etc.
- 50+hrs of training each week from top producers in the country
- Free stock gifts for reaching milestones
- HEALTHCARE BENEFITS! Best for those who are sole income provider or do not have a spouse with corporate benefits, but we have a program that is MUCH better than healthcare on the open market
- Easy and instant live support when you need it
- kvCore - one of the most powerful CRM's in Real Estate
- Workplace by Facebooks means you can reach out to and refer any agent anywhere in the company
- Adding new countries every month
- You can find community with those in your upline or in groups on Workplace
- My prediction: This truly is the Netflix that will close down the Blockbusters. Then after a few years, the other brokerages will shift to an eXp model, and take the roles of Disney+, Hulu, Peacock, etc.","- You get out what you put in. Anyone that thinks they will be hand-held will feel likely feel confused and isolated.
- You must show some initiative and drive to get yourself up and running. There is plenty of support, but you have to ask for it. No one is looking over your shoulder (which for me is a PRO!)"

Everyone is friendly and helpful, it is a company that truly values and shares the sense of Community.","Working for the corporate side, I feel like they can still improve benefits. Leaving a company with over 100 hours of banked sick time that I couldn't cash out to start out with nothing was the hard decision. It's been worth it so far. I just wish they had PTO in vacation hours and sick hours for those of us on the hourly pay scale. Salary individuals get an unlimited amount of PTO."

509,eXp Realty,One of the most unprofessional jobs I have ever had.,2021-06-30,1.0,Transaction Settlement Specialist,"The only two positives were the wages, and the fact that you could work from home.","Everything else was horrific at this job. Massive turn over, absolutely chaotic and insufficient training, unprofessional management, terrible benefits. I was constantly in a chaotic and unstructured environment, with management that had no idea what it was doing and was just chewing through new hires and spitting them out. Absolutely stay away from this company if you want something table and secure."
510,eXp Realty,"Great co-workers, pays below market,  CEO is an innovator not a manager, and Nepotism is practiced frequently",2021-06-30,2.0,Senior Accountant,"Working from home is great, great software supporting work from home, and no zoom calls. There are pockets of growth opportunities throughout all departments due to high growth. Great coworkers and a work environment that allows you to have relationships with coworkers in a remote environment, I always felt like I was part of a Team. Large enough company where multiple departments are available to reach out to for advice, as long as they h e time to respond because everyone is typically over worked.","Work life balance is non existent for operations teams like HR, Accounting, Legal, and Finance, the teams are also underpaid when compared to other similar industry teams. The CEO has said in meetings that the Accounting and Legal team is a service department for sales so they aren’t expected to support rather than guide, which in application translates to teams like Sales and Marketing reaching out to Accounting and Legal with unrealistic timelines and expectations and no regard for work life balance, and if you don’t turn around an agreement within their timeline they will move forward without your input or against your advisement and if something goes wrong, you’ll be asked to report on why and told to prevent it from happening again. The C level team participates unnecessarily in the hiring process of middle management and entry level positions in order to encourages and wear down HR to interview and hire their personal friends. Additionally, the CEO is an avid reader and innovator and fascinating, however he tends to pick his favorite book at that time and try to apply the philosophy of the book by telling others to do so, but he fails to empower teams under him to run with the philosophy and the agenda of implementing a new process or philosophy will fail to launch and just cause busy work. Then six months later he will read a new book or learn of a new software and have his team pivot yet again, example is holocracy and using holaspirit which people in meetings would sarcastically joke “oh! A new program to update and forget about, yay!”, or On the Ready which micromanaged how we set up Trello boards between teams but then fizzled away. Additionally, the other C-level that support the CEO are critical of him and don’t lend actionable support, but tend to say what the CEO wants to hear but not perform, which I think lends to failure to launch new initiatives and unnecessary internal strain on staff."

I read a negative review earlier, and I believe this person was simply mislead into a place that wasn't ever going to be good for them. The fact is, I love everything eXp is, but this Broker isn't for everyone. We have no office, or as the review said, ""bricks and mortar"" haha. But why would you want that? Offices are silly. Clients want to meet at homes. Every time I tried to meet a client at the office when I was elsewhere, clients always said, ""why can't I just go look at the home?"" eXp cut the office out, it's useless. You can get all of this training and live support in eXp World without wasting gas at an office you don't own. You have no boss, but you're an independent agent, you shouldn't want one as they don't pay you any money, they take it. We are tech based, very tech based. If you aren't a tech person, eXp may not be the best fit. If you like to ""go into the office"" everyday, we probably aren't for you. For me? I love it, and the 80% commission with a low cap is pretty sweet too.","None outside of minor critiques. Overall, I wake up everyday and do what I love with the latest technology to do it with.

It is cost effective, but requires you to be a self-starter. If you're the type of agent that is looking for a company that provides everything for you, then please don't join.

563,eXp Realty,I Cannot Recommend At This Time,2021-05-18,3.0,Accounts Receivable Team Lead,"Work from home
Seriously amazing coworkers","1- Overworked.
To say that eXp is growing at a fast pace is a gross understatement. Personally, I love staying busy, but our department was left severely short-staffed for a prolonged period of time which caused a major problem with burnout on our team. 
2-Feeling Unappreciated.
At least three people on our team, myself included, were each expected to perform the duties of two (sometimes three) staff for the aforementioned prolonged period of time, with no recognition and no additional compensation. At least two of these team members were then in real danger of being terminated when higher-ups felt that they were ""slacking"" (due to trying to perform the duties of 2 or 3). I was so ashamed of eXp.
3-Insufficient Tools.
Hopefully this will be getting better as it seems the company has finally realized how woefully inadequate the tools staff have been expected to work with are and there are improvements in that area coming down the road. In the meantime, tools are painfully insufficient and manual.
4-Lack of Management Accountability.
There seems to be nowhere safe to go to provide feedback or express concerns about your direct manager without fear of retribution. For the record, I found out, personally that the ""confidentiality"" of Employee Net Promoter Score (ENPS) Surveys...not confidential.
5-Lack of Thorough Planning
The MO of eXp has been to make changes to policies and procedures without the input of the teams tasked with implementing those changes. 
While occasional oversight is understandable, with eXp it is the rule and not the exception. It is incredibly embarrassing to have leadership announce a new initiative that will involve your team, yet you knew nothing about it! On a regular basis teams were tasked with implementing changes in policy or procedures without the tools or processes in place (or even available) to make it possible!"

585,eXp Realty,AMAZING benefits,2021-05-10,5.0,REALTOR®,One thing that gets completely overlooked is the healthcare that is offered through Clearwater. If you are a productive agent you actually get rewarded. The amount of stock my family and I have received from the ICON program has been life changing. The revenue share program can give you an opportunity to earn passive income for the rest of your life. From my research the EXP Realty fees beat all of the other major brokerages fees. I really don't understand why every agent isn't with EXP realty.,"If you're not going to recruit/attract any agents or you are only going to do 1-5 deals a year that are not luxury properties, EXP probably isn't for you.

KvCore being provided to all agents is another major bonus. It is a fantastic CRM that is provided for me.
I LOVE the stock that I receive! We also have revenue share whenever someone joins under a listed person as their sponsor.","While there is more training available than most brokerages, you must be eager and self disciplined to attend and gain the benefits. I do wish we planned more local events to connect with our local agents. Our area has really tried to do that once a month.

The biggest con is that some agents have gotten very sales pitchy because they can make really great passive income with revenue share. It is great but people do not enjoy being ""sold"" to and it makes people really off put with our company sadly."

739,eXp Realty,Was Great When I Started,2021-01-27,3.0,Onboarding Specialist,"Loved the fact you can work remote anywhere in the world.  I love the virtual world . It gives you the office feeling and culture without having to go into an office (I think more companies need to adopt this). 
When I first started it was great place to work with great managers that cared. Core values were followed,  communication and training was great, and employees valued.","After changing of very high positions,  company started going down hill. People were transitioned to new roles without being asked if they wanted them HR records weren't looked at, putting people that have bullied others in management positions. Theres a huge lack in communication and core values aren't being followed. Company is also pushing for the make or break it attitude when hiring and is completely lacking in training.  Training went down to practically nothing and is vague.  The make it or break it people make alot of mistakes,  cleaned up by others, while management honors the one that created a mess and steps on the people cleaning up the mess and making the wheel turn. 
Good employees are stepped on, while employees that continuously mess up get promoted, mainly cause their butt kissers, but can't do their job.  People aren't getting raises (even prior to covid). Seems the very higher up management (CFOS,  president,  etc.) are hiring their friends and some of the friends can't do the job, but keep the position. 
Seems the employees don't matter anymore and your not going to get anywhere unless your a favorite. It's now alot like high school with cliques and if your not in the management clique,  your getting treated poorly."

Structure! If you are a new broker/realtor and are craving a schedule of what to do in your first couple of months once your system is up and running in order to succeed, eXp is a great choice. 

Workplace: it’s an app identical to Facebook but for eXp. Includes a referral program and mentoring on literally anything from CRMs to lead gen, to contracts for dummies, and there are tens of thousands of people across the nation who will reply to any question you may have in a matter of seconds. 

You get 1k business cards and 25 presentation folders when you sign up",None that I can see aside from the 85 dolllar a month fee and the contractual agreement to get a full brokers license within 6 months of joining instead of the realtors association standard of 18 months here in NC.

768,eXp Realty,BEST BROKERAGE by far!,2021-01-11,5.0,Realtor,"I have so many great things to say about eXp! I interviewed with many brokerages before I chose eXp and this is why: The very low-no up front cost, LOWEST commission split until cap, and mentor program have been absolutely incredible!! I’m a brand new agent and I was initially worried about starting with a company like eXp but I have been so happy with it! I was given a mentor and she is incredible and so helpful! I have learned so much! They have free online classes to take on your own time whenever you want! 
The BEST thing about eXp and the reason I I will probably stay forever is that they offer STOCK options. It is a HUGE money making opportunity. My upline hasn’t even noticed the very minimal amount coming out for each transaction and now has over $40k JUST in stock 😱 and she’s fairly new to eXp AND real estate! EXp also wants everyone to succeed because as the company grows and succeeds, we all make more money! And because of this, everyone is willing to help everyone and everyone shares their amazing ideas. As opposed to most of the other companies who are known to be competitive and cutthroat. EXp is so supportive! They also supply websites with free lead generation like KVcore. Another amazing unbeatable factor is that it’s a virtual cloud brokerage, so I can sit and take classes and learn while sitting on the couch in my pajamas. It’s truly the perfect work from home brokerage where you can also get help from thousands of agents all over the country ALL THE TIME! Another plus is that any agent that joins eXp underneath you, you also make money off of! I don’t spend my time recruiting agents as I became a Realtor bc I wanted to do Real Estate but this is just a REALLY nice bonus!","So far I have nothing negative to say. If you don’t like to work from home and prefer to pay more money for an office then this would be your true con for eXp.

 To succeed in the Real Estate world at all, you have to be a MAJOR go-getter, self motivated, constant hustle and grind kind of person. You cannot be afraid to leap out of your comfort zone and definitely can’t be quick to give up!"

That I get to take part in revenue share. I'm a new agent. 5 months into this thing. Have 2 agents I sponsored, an independent brokerage of 28 talking working with me and walking through the process, and a few more folks in the process. THEN!!! We have the equity program and stock awards. Absolutely amazing. PLUS!!! To top it off! I'm 5 months in with 13 closed listings and 1 closed buyer. No way would I have known how to do that or been able to if it wasn't for the supportive and collaborative culture here. Thanks! I Love that eXp was created and that I got to start my career here over any other brokerage.","There is no limit to your growth and how much you can make.  There is literally no cap to what I could potentially make with revenue sharing.  I find myself getting caught up in day dreaming or dreaming bigger than my now which for me can be discouraging at times.  It's also a huge driver for me because I want to get to those goals of making 5 to 6 figures a month through the revenue share.  I want to hit the ICON agent status every year.  I want the rewards the company offers no matter how far they may be from me right now, I want to achieve these things."

The staff are very knowledgeable and provide any support needed to assist the Commercial Broker's real estate business. I have worked at different brokerages and I can personally attest that EXP is the best brokerage to work at hand down! Commercial Brokers save money because they do not have the overhead expenses which keep your expenses at a minimum. I am very excited to start my new journey with EXP Commercial as the Commercial Designated Managing Broker for Utah. I encourage new and experienced agent's to explore the benefits EXP has to offer by becoming part of the EXP Commercial or residential family.,There are no cons here!
862,eXp Realty,"Waste of time, racist, on Pacific Time, Broker barely accessible in NYS.",2020-11-05,1.0,Real Estate Salesperson,"The feeling of not being watched, but at the end of the day you have no real team, support.","I started working here in February. When Covid hit, I requested they waive the months fee of $80 (after I had upfrotned nearly $300 to join) since COVID put my state in Total lockdowns and people were dying daily in large numbers. Given they make millions a month on sheer dues  of 29,000+ agents they figured I was causing a wave and would risk their profits from dues. Those that left were mainly people of color in NYC, who were also new and realized that this company is greedy and is largely racking in profits from dues. I was immediately booted off the workplace, revoked of my license, access to my email, my data, my costs of over $400 was wasted as well as my time. They said ""I was not in culture"" what should I never request anything, or should people in a company not have a voice, and if they choose to articulate it, are they not in culture? Meeting with the ""leaders"" were condescending, calling me cute for being outspoken, and trying to ""make me heard"" with no tangible actions. This is better to be reported to the BBB.

 That was all the tip of the iceberg. I was sold as a new agent that I would have the ability to make more money with EXP, but upon starting as a new agent you have a 60/40 cut for the first 3 deals. And then you have 80/20 till you pay $16000 in commissions to EXP, for that year! So next year it's back to 80/20. Mind you if you have no actual support for deals and your mentor is obsessed with you spending time to recruit Instead of working on getting deals, you close nothing. 0*80% is still zero and thats what this is. It felt disgusting. 

Anywho not great for new agents. Very protective of their image, they have a whole department for it run by Jani Burke.  People are booted out of the ""workplace""for not being ""in culture"" aka not actively fangirling delusionally over EXP!"
863,eXp Realty,Best Move Ever!,2020-11-05,5.0,REALTOR&Reg;,"Information and answers available within minutes, not hours or days. Software for transactions is easy to use. Great collaboration. EVERY department is accessible at any time; not waiting a day for someone to answer an email. This is awesome.","Hmm. If you are an agent who thinks a brick and mortar office is a must, this may not be for you. I have always found a meeting location near my client instead of making them drive to me, so I don't miss it."

In 2001 when 9-11 occurred I left the airline industry and came back to the family business. I became a broker and opened my own company called Delmarva Resorts Realty at the Delaware beaches. In 2018 I explored moving my company to EXP so that I could move myself into retirement. In my second year at EXP my business exploded and I was able to pay off my credit card debt. I am on track to to spend winter in sunny florida!

They can fire you without a reason with no prior notice. Poor management with the staff, no training offered at the time I was employed there. Staff that work there tend to be clicky even though it's a remote work environment, so a lot of favoritism goes on between managers and staff.

1023,eXp Realty,Left High and Dry,2020-06-15,1.0,Product Launch Specialist,I never got to experience any,"I was hired at EXP as a Product Launch Specialist in March 2020 after a three month hiring process. Multiple people left the company in that time so I was bounced around. Finally at the end of March I was extremely excited to start for the company and accepted my offer letter. It was a perfect match- where my background aligned 1:1 with the role, and I saw a lot of possible quick adjustments to their platform with my knowledge that would really improve the user experience for brokers, and bring new ones on. At the end of March coronavirus quarantine hit and my start date was canceled. It's unfortunate but what was happening nationwide at the time and understandable. I was told we would be postponed. I knew that meant indefinitely. Fine, things happen. I can understand that. It was a shame because I moved cross-country for the position, and they canceled six days before it was meant to start. But again, I understand. 

What I don't understand is that since that time, they have been hiring for multiple similar roles at both EXP and VirBELA and did not once call me or consider me, or the nine other people they canceled on that date. They should do right by us and we should be first in line for any new positions. I don't know if it's a failure by Mike Vein, Kirk Lattner, Laura Styles, or the whole HR division. But treating people like they don't matter and are expendable, is the reason this company has NO BUSINESS being near the 'Top Places to Work on Glassdoor' and why you should avoid them."

1047,eXp Realty,My experience with eXp was 100% the opposite of what I expected.,2020-05-12,1.0,Realtor,"The concept is good, training is good if you have some guidance","The rev share has inexperienced agents recruiting and than dropping the ball. I was told not to contact one of my managing brokers because he was no longer with eXp and that was not true. Found out a week later, in a date meeting, that he was indeed the person I needed to contact. If you have a question or a referral it can take days for someone to get back you. because the sponsor that recruited me was/ is more interested in recruiting and complaining about having to do anything I had a very negative experience with eXp. I would be Leary and clarify that the person attempting to recruit you has it together, knows what they are doing, is Honest, Trustworthy and has real estate sales experience beyond your own and can answer questions about eXp and actually wants to see agents succeed within the organization. I had closings every month before eXp my business slowed and dealing with my sponsor was an unproductive nightmare.  My sponsor had me buy her family dinner and insisted on ordering on her laptop when I offered to order form my own device she insisted and when I asked to remove my debit card information from her laptop she got angry and said, you either trust me or you don’t. Being new with eXp and depending on her for some help with onboarding and trusting her at all was a huge mistake. Tech support you can submit a ticket and schedule support it can takes days to get tech support assistance. Be careful of who you choose to sponsor you when you join eXp. I would have switched sponsors but was told it is more trouble than it is worth. It was easier to transfer my license to a brokerage that actually has great people and if I have a question they are pleasant and my business is already doing much better. 6 listings and can focus on productivity and my clients."
1048,eXp Realty,Great Place to work.,2020-05-11,5.0,Agent,"Great cloud based technology; training classes, brokers always available to help, great staff and agents.Profit sharing is a big plus...lots of ways to make money including recruiting.

1049,eXp Realty,Good culture.... too much going on,2020-05-09,3.0,Real Estate Agent,"People will help you gladly.
There is something new to learn at this place",There are many fees and it feels like they are trying too many things at once.

They focus on building the business to best serve our clients while ensuring our long term success and profitability...oh and did I mention getting a great stock bonus for milestones and my cap back as company stock, shareholders meetings, etc. I LOVE owning a piece of my brokerage! Oh, and agent healthcare plans at the LOWEST prices I've seen!",NONE ! They take such great care of their agents and staff I cannot think of any negative thing to say!
1051,eXp Realty,Easy Transition from other brokerage,2020-05-07,5.0,Realtor,eXp is very forward thinking and on top of technology. Great commission structure and incentives for growth.,Little bit of a learning curve for the technology but there is a ton of support for new agents.
1052,eXp Realty,Losing touch with their core values,2020-05-06,1.0,Corporate Staff Member,"Opportunities if you’re willing to brown nose, join the boys club or work 7 days a week.","Lots of false promises. HR has been talking about boosting morale but they don’t have a clue. Their ideas seem to be those made up by people who have too much time on their hands while the implementers are working extreme hours daily just to keep up. We had layoffs (which was handled EXTREMELY poorly) and then they hire people and promote those who aren’t even putting in the work... and move others who aren’t even qualified into positions. It’s disheartening, discouraging and leaves many of us feeling taken advantage of. Overworked, under appreciated and many times leadership takes credit for what the little guys are doing."
1053,eXp Realty,"Great benefits, remote work",2020-05-05,5.0,Administrative Assistant,"The people I work with are great and they make it feel like a real team even though we've never met, we work remotely and in our virtual world. Interesting work. Excellent benefits.",None that come to mind.

1055,eXp Realty,Great Progressive Brokerage,2020-04-29,5.0,Realtor,They provide all the necessary tools you need to be a successful agent.,Lack of face to face interaction with other agents.
1056,eXp Realty,New Agent,2020-04-29,2.0,Real Estate Agent,"Access to classes online, l have always got some sort of response via email. Older agents do really well! Modern business model",I’ll be honest I haven’t had the best experience. I am a brand new agent who feels I was mislead on all the resources and trainings I would have. I have taken as many online classes as I’ve been able to and have mainly trained myself with online coaches. I join as many calls as I can a week. It’s like learning a complex business by listening to a podcast. Be aware as a new agent you will have your fees AND an additional 10% plus another 10% for your mentor and “mentoring fees” I wouldn’t write this review if I hadn’t exhausted all my resources. Many times reaching out as a new agent I have been met with a dismissive attitude. Even from my state broker. Who has this giant chip on her shoulder for some reason. I’ve owned a business before so I don’t need hand holding but if the overall attitude is that new agents aren’t important than why bring them on? I’m doing really well because of my drive not because of the support from eXp. My intention was to be proud of the brokerage I joined but if one more person at this company speaks down to me or doesn’t construct a professional email I’m going to have to go somewhere else. Learning a new industry is hard enough and people need people in this type of business. I just wish this felt more like a tribe.

1072,eXp Realty,Indifferent,2019-12-27,3.0,Realtor,"If independence and little need of support are what you're looking for, eXp could be a good fit. The portal, CRM and stock options are a perk for the fees, but I wouldn't recommend this brokerage to new agents.","It really depends on what your business goals are. For a well established agent with proven systems already in place eXp could be great. If you need more coaching and support, this may not be the fit for you yet. I don't think my managing brokers could pick me out in a crowd of 10 people and were indifferent about people joining or leaving the company. This worked fine for a year, but I've decided to leave for more proactive involvement. Some of the training is great and easy to attend, just know that most of it is on a national level with few local opportunities."

I feel so fortunate to be able to watch this company grow!,"The only real complaint I have is that they won't fire people.  There are many people here who do not do their jobs, but there seems to be a policy against letting people go. These people are not beneficial to the company or the morale."
1092,eXp Realty,Worst Decision ever made,2019-09-23,1.0,Realtor,"Started off great, as I came over with a Team and our TL made it sound like the best decision ever, were we wrong. From day 2, it went downhill, so there are no Pros to report.","'Almost' everyone cares more about revenue share than the actual business. They tend to forget what we are here to for, and that is to assist the Home buyer and Home seller buy and sell their homes. Not buy and sell a real estate company. The culture does not exist because each Agent is out for themselves, and themselves only. Not why I received my Real Estate License. Due to the Agent's, we aligned with constantly calling me asking how many Agents I have added to my downline almost daily, I had enough and it was time to go. Money doesn't drive me, helping my community does."
1093,eXp Realty,Worst broker to hold your license,2019-09-20,1.0,Realtor,Absolutely no pros at all.,It’s all fluff guys. Their stock is not stable or profitable. The promise of low fees is a cover for the fact you’ll pay more fees here than anywhere else. They will take your money. How do you think they have been able to grow. This place is a Piramid scheme. And when you try to leave they will take 20% of every deal you have or they won’t give them to you. Worst broker I’ve ever talked to. Doesn’t know what she’s doing and doesn’t communicate. Terrible company.

After the mountain of fees, commission split isn’t very good.  BTW, it’s NOT 80/20 after all the fees."
1097,eXp Realty,Best Decision I Ever Made For My Business,2019-09-02,5.0,Real Estate Broker,"As a 16 year real estate professional, I am so blessed to have aligned with eXp Realty. I wish this model was available to me sooner in my career. The old traditional brokerage model never made sense to me (coming from a corporate and business background). I never fully saw the value in  it and while there are different franchises and names, they all over some variety of the same broken model.  What I love the most about eXp is the connection I have with other agents - I was worried that I would feel isolated but it is the exact opposite. This company attracts contributors and because it is one company using the same platform, I can connect with agents across the USA and soon to be the world. This is the biggest benefit for me.  The tools, resources etc are just an added bonus. And of course, the ability to have multiple ways to build wealth is amazing.","The company is growing and as such, there are some glitches here and there. But that is to be expected and nothing that cannot be dealt with."
1098,eXp Realty,Great Company,2019-08-26,5.0,Realtor,The split is great! I like being able to attend virtual trainings and having access to a national referral network of agents.,Not having a physical office.

Financially it's a no brainer! Seriously!
EVERYONE is VERY supportive and helpful!  
There are opportunities to earn a passive income!
It's a publicly traded company! That means stock!
ALL the coaches out there say to market YOURSELF ... eXp is a supporter!
eXp provides all the tools any realtor would need to be successful ... and if you're not successful, it's not because if eXp!  

Once you have seen the full presentation ... it's hard not to say YES!","If you're NOT a self starter, this company is not for you.  If you spend time in the office instead of showing homes to buyers, meeting sellers at their home ... then eXp is not for you."

I've built a business that provides an income for my family I couldn't get anywhere else.  It took 3 years, but it's very achievable.","Sometimes people don't get connected to everything and fall off.  I've found that an agents sponsor can really dictate a lot of their success.

Constantly changing rules that are not legal or lawful. Extremely fake management who favors certain employees who are not qualified to even do the job. These employees were hired because of growth and they pretty much just took anyone.
They have an internal Facebook (workplace) where they constantly bash other real estate companies. not good.
I am only here for the paycheck for now."

To get the most of your experience here, engagement is key. Without brick and mortar, it means it is entirely up to you to create an experience, learn and grow taking the initiative to collaborate with other agents, or find the information you are looking for.

Great employee benefits and reasonable pay. Never have I been so easily connected with upper level managers, supervisors! It's better than any ""Open Door Policy"" I've ever known! They are continually working to improve the processes we have in place to better serve our agents and our communities. Very kind and giving to those agents who experienced damage from storms and fires and MANAGEMENT actually got on phones to CALL AGENTS directly to check on them! A-MA-ZING!!! They truly care about us! Our teams work well together and hold each other up should one be sick or unable to perform and we jump in to help each other when the workload is heavier for one!",The biggest con is that I didn't think of this platform myself and that I didn't join the company sooner. The only con aside from that is the company is growing so quickly that we have a lot of work but it's a great thing knowing others are seeing the benefit of being eXp Realty agents and our teammates are always here to help each other when one is busier than another or takes a day off - We all just pitch in to care for each other.
1147,eXp Realty,No mentorship - Not good for new inexperienced sales agents,2018-12-11,1.0,Sales Agent,I loved the concept of the virtual company.  Took all the classes offered.,"As a new realtor, I was signed up with the “promise” of guidance and mentorship.  I even signed a contract twice because I was told my first one expired, because I signed it and they did not.  I fulfilled  my part of the mentorship contract.  I repeatedly asked the office each week for months that signed me up when am I going to get mentorship as indicated in my contract agreement, they just told me not from them.  They said they had no idea and would reach out to the broker, and still nothing.  After six months waiting for someone to give me some hands on experience per the agreement, I had to get a full-time job somewhere else.  eXp sure doesn’t have any problem deducting $85 out of my bank account each month for nothing."
1148,eXp Realty,Realtor,2018-12-10,5.0,Realtor,The technology and tools we are given to help us do our jobs is like NOTHING I've ever experienced.

Work in virtual world creates an atmosphere  unlike any  other allowing you to accomplish tasks you would not be able to accomplish if your corporation was spread across the United States.

We are able to meet with our agents in our offices at any time even though we are located in one city and they are spread across the state, we are available to them.  This is unlike any other brokerage and no other brokerage can offer this service to their agents.  I love to wake up in the morning and go to work in my virtual office.  I meet every morning with my staff, we have a brief ""stand up"", which Glen has taught us, and start our day.  Even though we do not work from a traditional office, we are still together, communicating with each other during the day, walking into each other's virtual offices, just as if we were in a bricks and mortar office.

The company is really marketing towards recruiting agents, mainly experienced agents and not training new, inexperienced agents. I find myself without the support that a new agent needs. I manage to learn something new everyday, attending classes offered through exp cloud platform. But even those are geared more towards seasoned agents. I spend much of my day scouring you tube, online articles, anywhere that I can gain new information. I had no leads, no referrals, no spheres, pretty much started form scratch. There really is no mentoring program that I know of and I had to learn on my own how to do basic tasks like creating a  CMA, maketing, scripts, etc. on my own.  I've had two listing presentations, that I did not get, a couple of showings, that I did not close. I'm generating leads online but nothing solid.

The ability to act as a mini broker without any liability or expense is life changing as that passive income was reserved for brokers in the past. Being an owner allows us to have a voice and leadership listens. We can buy stock (yes the company went Public) at a discount with each closing, earn stoke which gives us a real exit strategy.

If you expect to get things accomplished you cannot expect to communicate via email .  But that's whats great, visit the virtual world and walk right into agent services, tech support, etc.  No reason to feel left out or forgotten, but you have to be assertive.  However that's not a big deal if you like to be independent as I do.

Cloud based meetings and agent support from transaction management to live tech support can be found in the Cloud…whether at home, in my office, or at the beach.  No company can match this offering.  Approximately 25 hours of live training is provided in the Cloud (called EXP World) as well as a myriad of recorded training programs.  There is NO better back office than what is provided each agent at Exp Enterprise.  I can meet with ANY agent or support person anytime in AVATAR format and speak live with them at EXP WORLD.  Simply incredible.....

Our strong real estate growth culture is supported by intuitive software packages Kunnversion and Commissions, Inc. (virtually free!!)  Other exceptional  tenants of the EXP culture include community service, innovation, and simply having FUN while supporting one another.  

Revenue Share replaces the much less appealing profit share of other companies and Stock Ownership is every agents privilege here at EXP.  If that is not good enough, our cap fee is 24% less than  most leading real estate firms ….AND as an Icon Agent, selling approximately 30 properties (depends on transaction size) will help you attain ICON agent status and EXP will give you the cap fees back in company stock!

Review the growth of our stock at the symbol EXPI.   I purchased a batch myself in September at $3.25…….it now sits at the $8 level.  
(of course I encourage everyone to do their own homework on this as an investment)

Our agent population just hit 6,000 nationally and is on a strong upswing that could easily double in 2018.  

So….just wanted to share my thoughts as a Kansas City market leading agent that recently sold his stock in a Market Center with Keller Williams to join EXP.

With 21 years of experience, 13 years with Prudential and 8 years with/as a Keller Williams Market Center Investor/Agent…..I know most models out there.
