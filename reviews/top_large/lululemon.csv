309,lululemon,"Reap your benefits, stay in your lane, do ONLY your job, don't be so serious, and don't get stuck in the loop.",2022-02-09,3.0,Educator,"The best things you can takeaway from working at lululemon are skills and knowledge. At lululemon, entrepreneurship and leadership are at the core of it's culture, so constantly being surrounded by that really forces you to grow. You learn to trust yourself in your decisions and gain a wealth of knowledge about the hows and whys the business is so successful. As an educator, you are constantly presented with learning opportunities and situations to apply or share your knowledge. It's easy to figure out your strengths at the store and find a place for you where you can maximize them. 
Unlike other retailers, you are encouraged to make connections with guests that don't necessarily revolve around the brand or the product. Your job is to give people a full experience from when they walk through the door to the moment they leave, regardless of whether they buy something or not. The social aspect of the job can be really fun if you love to chat with strangers.
The benefits are quite swell in terms of what other retail jobs of similar caliber offer. Part-time and full-time workers receive a monthly allowance for workout classes and studios. The employee share purchase plan is perhaps one of the best perks but is only offered to full-time employees -- I highly recommend looking into this. 
Another perk about working here is they make it easy for you to relocate to another store. If you have a life change and are moving to another city but want to keep your job, they help you find another store closer to your new location. The best part about this is that you keep your job with the company and the sense of community that comes with it. Also, covid relief payment was generous during covid closures.","Lack of diversity and not as inclusive as the company says it is, toxic leaders, sales will always trump the importance of your well-being, unrealistic expectations of staff, overworked and understaffed during covid, gaslighting employees about moving up in the company"

- emphasize on personal development as there are checkins happening every quarter
- I had a good time mainly due to great team + manager","- depending on your career goal, in my opinion, the pay is not justifiable with the amount of task they request (they keep relate it to as part of the ""development"" but iykyk). 
- management and your team would ultimately create the work environment. unfortunately for me, when the change of manager happened, it went down the drain. manager was micromanaging and while the company takes in feedback, change needs to happen."

387,lululemon,Opportunities are few.,2022-01-28,2.0,Educator,"Fun people to work with (non-management).

If you are young, out of college, want a discount and don't plan on being with the company longer than a year, two max (in a part time role) go for it. 

If you are full time, or above, the responsibilities become incredibly overwrought and you are barely paid a dollar higher than those working in non-management roles.","The internal surveys for employees are consistently mediocre at best. There is no difference of opinion and the management use the ""feedback"" system to regulate those who might disagree or cause ""conflict"". 

Lululemon performs and preaches a ""progressive"" culture, but that is more brand than it is reality. A fellow employee once reported a workplace violation to HR, and NONE of the people who witnessed it were contacted. The case was closed with no resolution, and THEY were reprimanded for asking why nobody was contacted. The company overall is designed along similar lines. Overall toxic ""positivity"" culture that is used to micromanage or target workers who don't fit the mold. Leadership (Assistant/Store Managers) can be, and are often, incredibly difficult to work with. I've never experienced such a strict hierarchy that is so resistant to change.

The company is built upon a system of ""feedback"" which allows the company to micromanage performance and actively encourages leaders to document (seek out) ""flaws"" in their employees. Natural bias makes this a very toxic system, yet there is no accountability for the inevitable turnaround of workers. I have worked for the company 3+ years. With the exception of one, every single full time or ""key leader"" (lowest manager you can be) I've worked with has left the company because of their experience.

It is incredibly difficult to get a better paying, let alone ""office"" job in the company. I have seen multiple people denied career opportunities (getting permanent status for health care benefits) because of management tanking their transfer or career mobility. Management roles are often contracted, precisely to micromanage employees and exhaust labor, or eliminate those who don't do well to their standards. This makes long term life planning, and over all career planning, depend entirely on highly variable and relative factors. If you have a difficult manager, you are at a more difficult vantage for career options."

Saw workers often get taken advantage of to extend their shifts - sometimes to 12-14 hour days during the holidays. Most store leadership doesn't even work on the floor and leave their staff to deal with difficult guests. 

-Often employees were allowed to come to work sick during a pandemic because there was no one else available for coverage. This happened several times throughout COVID-19. 

-Company preaches that they care about the employee experience, but they do not. Store leaders are often not versed in employment laws nor do they care about employee well being. 

-Typically cut hours tremendously and staffed the store short on busy days. Leadership never covered call offs. 

-Filed several complaints against management with regional Human Resources (who lives on the other side of the country and had never visited our store in person) and was removed from the schedule consequently for speaking up as an advocate for my team members. 

-Leadership gossips about team members calling those that hold them accountable to do their job ""difficult"". 

-Customers treat you horribly - often demanding you to do things against store and company policy and leadership would just break rules rather than educate the guest on the appropriate rules."

It doesn’t however apply to the Bath store - If you are a friend or related to the management team you get promoted or offered a job. You do not need much retail experience to get a Keyleader position. 

There is no safe space outside of work. I was seen comforting a member of my team at the gym by my manager’s roommate. I was then sat down and informed I would be getting a negative log because ‘a member of the community has heard you speaking negatively about lululemon’. Which wasn’t true it was the roommate who saw us. 

I went to head office for advice instead they went and told management. Management then continued to exclude me from the leadership group. I suffered mentally and eventually had to leave for my own mental health. I expected more from a company who are known to be pioneers in wellness. 

I am very disappointed in the way things have been handled and they have let management continue to abuse the system. 

They still continue to talk about me negatively to people that know me in the community. I have written to head office, but again nothing was done. 

This is not the first instance that a key leader has left due to the lack of communication and work culture at lululemon Bath."

That year we topped over 2 Billion in digital sales by Q3 if I recall, for reference we made our accumulative first Billion by 2019 and they cut digital bonuses because “covid” its almost funny that the only part of the org that brought in revenue they cut those works bonuses. When I left so were many other of the really good engineers as we all knew the market would pay way higher and we were in higher demand now with covid, only people still on digital are people that are the less driven engineers.

910,lululemon,Pros and Cons of working as an Educator at lululemon (EU),2021-10-08,4.0,Educator,"- An overall great management support and a team that truly cares.
- Generous discounts on products. 
- Possible career progression within the store.
- A great bonus system that based on Team performance rather than invidiual sales performance. If the Team reaches the sales target by the end of the month, the whole Team gets a bonus. This motivates us to work together towards the goal.
- Possibilties to pick up hours and shifts. 
- Receiving support and encouragement to achieve your personal goals. A big focus on personal development.
- Fantastic products - Once you go lululemon, you'll never go back :)
- Sweat benefits, reimbursement of workout classes .
- An opportunity to network within your local sport, fitness and yoga community, you will meet with many industry professionals.
- Overall a great salary - bonuses during busy seasons are amazing and there are also possibilities to get a pay raise after a year (based on performance).
- Job security during Covid. (No layoffs, or reduced pay)","- It can get stressful on the retail floor, especially with all the Covid measures and when you are being short staffed. 
- Irregular schedules that can make your work-life balance tricky.
- Working on weekends. (Saturdays are mandatory)
- There is a 2 months blackout period (mid November- mid January) when you aren't allowed to take any vacation.
- Little to none career opportunities within the company that's outside the store itself.
- You will be expected to join local workout classes. This might sounds like a pro at first, but not really when you work already full time, live far from the city, or just want to have a better work-life balance and do workouts on your own terms. Not everyone enjoys mandatory workout classes on top of their working hours.
- The company culture is kind of like a toxic positivity echo chamber that will be also constantly shoved down on your throat. 
- Too much personal talk. Some people really like this but I prefer keeping my private life to myself. 
- Temptation to buy stuff all the time.
- Favoritism and micromanagement can be present at times. 
- Definitely not for introverts. You will be required to actively engage with guests at all times, be cheerful and energetic. The company is very specific about how you approach people and puts a lot of mental pressure on you. This along with the constant feedback on your mannerism can get exhausting real quick.
- Retail as usual: rude, demanding and entitled 'guests' here and there. In general, the brand attracts a lot of karens."

I relished the day I could work at my favorite store. I believed I would grow with the company and looked forward to a career with Lululemon. I was sadly mistaken,"Local-level management is indifferent, immature, lacking empathy, and is ill-equipped to manage and many of their decision practices are inconsistent and arbitrary. The mental wellbeing of it's employees is the furthest thing from their minds and they do little to promote an environment where you feel supported. I often question my self-worth given the lack of regard they have for me as an individual.

Management doesn't care about racist micro agressions, or racist attitudes towards black employees. White employees are able to do whatever and leave when they want but if a black employees tries to call out it's an entire issue. This was witnessed several times. I had several calls and exchanges with management in my two years there. The CEO is nice but doesn't give a damn about the Atlanta market because our store was suffering because of bad management and nothing was done.  Development plans do not exist, you will remain an educator unless you are popular with management. I can honestly go on for days about how horrific this place was to work at.

Been with the company for 4 years now and compensated less than others with only 1-2 years of external equal experience. When career planning the objectives are often vague for how to level up.

1242,lululemon,This is the least inclusive company I have ever been in contact with,2021-07-06,1.0,Lululemon Key Leader,"There were absolutely no pros at the location where I worked.

*I would give 0 stars if it allowed for that","I worked at lululemon on two separate occasions. After leaving the first time I thought maybe I had not given the organization a fair chance, so years later I returned. I began as a part-time educator and worked my way up to a full time Key Leader and ended up being with the company for two years until I absolutely could not take it any longer.

They constantly claim inclusivity but that is only true if you agree with upper management and have the exact same values as them, anything less is not accepted and you are forced out of the organization by passive aggressive bullying. 

They did offer some pay during Covid when stores were closed and this was considerate of them. Once the doors re-opened all bets were off. Working in a leadership role was detrimental to my mental health. I would leave the store and actually be inside of the store always feeling less-than because I did not align with the values of other leadership. Because of this I was forced to take their criticism and feedback, often crying in the back room of the store because of a particular assistant store manager who ruined our entire operation. Leadership would ask you to give feedback but when you did give it to them they would make excuses or say that your feedback was not relevant and totally disregard it. I often tried to voice my concerns and feedback within the store and they would tell me it ""didn't land correctly"" and then make excuses for their behavior and say that nothing they had done was incorrect or wrong.

The store manager was so disengaged from what was going on inside of the store that she left most of it to the ASM who ruined the entire operation by choosing her favorite employees and showing favortism outwardly to them in front of others. She would take certain people in the back to chit chat while leaving others on the floor to run it alone.

It was OK for employees to come in and speak about defunding the police, politics, ask people if they were vaccinated, etc. but if you showed a slightly different view or disagree you were shunned. 

I feel that I was forced out of the organization by the ASM and the SM, as well as an SM from another store where I interviewed. I will never recommend this organization to anyone that I come in contact with because of the way that I was treated. It was absolutely horrible."

Pay equity... Not very transparent against employee intersections.
Pay rises as a global business after hard work-- non existent unless you're in the accepted or aloof leadership crew.

Hierarchical in headoffice. Internal politics are less visible on first glance but rife.

Lack of autonomy and space to make your mark.

Endless and often unnecessary processes to deliver brand work. Feels like you're in an endless feedback loop.

Fake niceness. Lack of directness.

Not a very creative environment at all. Risk averse to keep every customer happy at the cost of employee well-being.

Outward perception soooo different from internal experience.

Lots of overtime and stress. Often not seen. Lots of people took stress leave during my time there.

Not enough diversity in managerial positions to even get anywhere if you're a minority doing the work.

Very few folks from marginalized backgrounds in brand. Echo chamber of similar people.

Few opportunities for newbies to enter the organisation in HQ. Most people are years into their career. Doesn't create space for diversity, young talent, or evolving from the ""rinse and repeat"" brand activity.

Groupthink.

Like wading through treacle if you're forward-thinking, ambitious, and want to see results faster than after months/years.

Clunky all round.

Rare social activities or fun times unless you like working out with your peers at hosted classes.

Lack of movement forward. Can feel slow internally.

Telesales-like headoffice prior to the pandemic...says it all.

Waffly, company-specific language makes it feel like a cult if you're new or don't subscribe.

Conform to succeed system.

Can cause ptsd or a feeling of exclusion if you're a minority or not a 'Vancouverite.'"

1323,lululemon,Great stepping stone but toxic and disorganized organization,2021-06-16,2.0,GEC Support,"Can only speak to the GEC

- A lot of autonomy in the work
- Get a lot of exposure to different projects if keen and willing
- Work with a variety of individuals
- Can move up internally after some time if you are keen on another role.","- GEC specifically has some of the worst pay I've seen at an organization that requires this much from employees.

- Although work/life balance can be good for some, I personally didn't have a great experience with this side of the job. The team I worked for demanded nearly 10 hour days from me over my 10 months to meet project deadlines. When I asked for support they shrugged it off and said that there was no bandwidth.

- A lot of gossip and toxic behavior even while working remotely. This is especially true if you give feedback where you don't see eye to eye with someone else. The feedback will be taken negatively and instead of constructive discussion it will be taken as you ""complaining"".

- No onboarding for support staff at the GEC. You are expected to start day one and figure everything out on your own. As time goes on you realize how messy everything is but you don't have time to fix it because deliverables begin to pile on. You end up just confiding to the processes because there is no point to fix them if everyone just wants what has been done previously.

- Very very disorganized company. There is very little system to how processes are done which in turn creates a lot of confusion on how to go about a project or report.

- Management and employee disconnect creates a lot of discussions ""on getting it done scrappy"". Management will announce a strategic initiative and given the role, tools, budget, and resources in place at the GEC almost all of these initiatives have no system to track errors and it hyper-inflates the success of the project.

- A lot of bureaucracy in the way processes are handled. You get a lot of autonomy in figuring out solutions, but to implement them is another story.

- The way bonus is calculated, no matter how much or how little you do you will receive the 10% middle payout."

1430,lululemon,Great company but not great store leadership,2021-05-17,3.0,Lululemon Key Leader,"Work ethics, philosophy, discount, team, great quality clothes, core values","Leadership, feedback, hours, short breaks, lack of transparency"
1431,lululemon,Good Place to Stagnate,2021-05-17,3.0,Digital Analyst,"Strong culture. If it works for you, you'll fit in great - if not, it will be obvious quite quickly. Lots of opportunity for personal development (although do not expect it to improve your position or compensation). Benefits are decent (last year they doubled the therapy benefit), although they recently cut vacation hours. Generally speaking you will work with good people who are earnest and positive. They are trying to push forward on D&I and a lot of the people doing the work are good at it, but they're under resourced and the things they've been allowed to focus on are fairly limited in scope. Not sure if this is a pro or a con but it is very, very difficult to get fired unless you do something truly appalling or someone has it in for you - poor performance or incompetence is no barrier to longevity here. If you're a workaholic, you'll love it here.","No career advancement - unless you have a highly motivated manager or director who thinks of you and makes space for you. Being a lifer (6+ years), having a significant other in leadership, or being a cisgendered straight white man will also help. 

Despite the premium brand, the company is surprisingly stingy regarding compensation and resourcing. They cryptically refer to yearly cost of living raises (between 1% and 3%) as ""merit"" as though it was earned through performance (receiving anything other than a ""merit"" increase is rare at review). The stated approach to compensation is ""pay for performance"" - there's a bonus structure that's made up partially of individual performance and partially of company performance. However, individual performance rewards are dependent on budget, so effectively your own efforts don't matter all that much. 

You will hear a LOT of dissonant conversations around performance - they love to hype you up on how well the company is doing until it's time to sit down for your annual review, at which point the discussion will immediately become about how tight the budget is and how there's no room for salary increases.

Like many places in Vancouver, pay is non competitive. If you are not the primary income earner in your household or you have family money, you'll do fine, but otherwise expect to continue scraping and struggling. Most people who don't fit in those two categories continue to live with roommates or in small apartments in the suburbs. One of the best and most effective ways to advance your career at lululemon is to leave - seriously, people leave and come back to better roles.

Recognition is rampant in the form of shoutouts and awards and email chains - but do not ever expect this to translate into compensation or title adjustments.
 
When you start you will receive an old laptop and will have to fight to get any peripherals (most people just buy things themselves). They sent everyone home in March 2020 and hypothetical return to work isn't until September 2021 at the earliest - the only benefit supplied was $200 to buy a brand new, prefab desk during the era when desks were impossible to acquire. (Compare that to $1000 at Shopify for anything you needed).

Office life (for those of us that remember it) is loud and crowded and likely to stay that way. All three offices were over capacity before the pandemic and there's only been a hiring frenzy since. Many teams were already working in shifts and sharing desks. Several of the smaller offices were shifting towards ""hotel desking"" (Like WeWork) - where you have no assigned seating and no guarantee of finding a seat either. Much like the limited parking it is first come first serve. There is/was a new office being built but it was ""paused"" in September of 2020 - no word yet on its return, but I wouldn't hold my breath.

They have this very interesting structure they refer to as ""Sabbatical"" that you become eligible for at certain levels of tenure (3+ years). As you may know, professors on ""sabbatical"" are paid - you are NOT paid on lululemon ""sabbatical"", so it's best referred to as ""unpaid leave"". It's great if you, like I mentioned above, are someone who isn't the primary income earner or you have family money - take some time off! Otherwise, it's not really a ""benefit"" at all.

I once heard someone describe an education at an Ivy League university as one where ""you get out of it what you put into it"". At lulu the company gets out of YOU what you put into it. If you're looking for somewhere to cool your heels a bit, temper expectations about yourself. You can work yourself into a froth and people will tell you you're amazing or you can tread water and nobody minds - your paycheque will come the same either way. :)"

1507,lululemon,Really disappointing technology organization,2021-04-27,2.0,Senior Software Engineer,"- Employee discounts
- Pretty decent mental health benefits
- Exposure to new technologies","The stark contrast between the technology organization and beyond is really disappointing. Some departments run like an unstable family business is run with little to no regard for career progression and aligning employee skills with actual business needs. The top level management in the technology org seem to leave in a luxury world, with lots of power and lots of benefits, this creates a desire in individual contributors to want to attain those levels, even though it might not exactly be possible, due to the instability mentioned above. There is really little to no direction from top leadership and it seems they're there just to fulfill all righteousness. This seeps into the teams and creates an unhealthy culture. Lastly they chose to rather hire a lot of contractors rather than full time employees, and you can see the impact of this on the kinds of software and infrastructure that currently exists. It's evident that no real commitment was made and people just kinda put things in working condition and left it at that. But somehow no one seems to have an issue with spending long hours and late nights working on issues that could have been resolved without human involvement. There's this idea that overworking yourself is applauded, praising people for working 17 hours, sleeping only a few hours and coming back to work to work another 17 hours. When that work culture is applauded in company meetings, you can see how one can feel like they're not doing enough if they aren't working late. Overall really disappointed in my experience at lululemon."

They are definitely not the ""yogi's"" they want to be, not exactly ""work-life balance"" advocates, a lot of passive aggressiveness and the upper management loves to gossip about others. It was definitely a bit of a toxic environment. It almost moves too fast where you don't let the new people settle in."
1796,lululemon,Great Job but things you should know going into it,2021-02-26,3.0,Educator,"Great atmosphere, good pay, personal growth is facilitated, family atmosphere, option to transfer stores temporarily if you are going out of town and want to work a shift or two over vacation, great employee discount","Poor management (while I was there), Feedback can come off negatively (even for athletes) due to the way they run their stores (all employees can give employees constructive criticism) so for those who don't know how to properly give constructive criticism, they can come off very rude. Not much room to grow within the company despite the fact that they promote this heavily. I watched an assistant store manager of 4 years not get the management job when she was clearly the one who deserved it."

There are also some great office goodies and events that happen every so often.

- great coworkers
- fun events
- office goodies
- chance to grow and develop to other departments
- company that focuses on living healthy lives","The job as a guest educator is not so rewarding. You deal with more angry guests than positive or happy ones and it can feel like you're in a constant cycle of appeasing entitled people. This can make you feel exhausted by the end of the day or even halfway through. They also care a lot more about numbers/productivity than the actual interaction you have with the guest - which can be a big downfall for those who actually care about who they're helping. This also can make a lot of people feel stressed, pressured or overall uneasy about how well they're actually doing. 

- angry guests
- pressure to fulfill numbers (doubled with pressure to make people happy)
- intricate computer system that takes time to learn
- lots of individual work - little time to actually feel connected with the people around you

There is lots to learn.","There is no system or culture focusing on developing people in place, even though they still claim so, because it was a focus in the past. They got rid of coaching possibilities for new managers and they don't pick people based on their people skills for manager positions. Your development depends on your direct manager. Great if you have a good manager that cares about people on their team and wants you to grow. Nearly impossible to grow on your own and impossible under bad managers. People are generally forced to do jobs way higher than their position/ pay. Its generally expected to work long hours in product and the standard is overworked and underpaid people. Most higher level positions are hired from the outside - which is where the budget goes. There is never a budget for a promotion and people never get promoted in time/when they deserve it (but when they're already working for 2 or a responsibility way higher than the promotion). 
Good learning curve but not sustainable."

75% off the original price of marked down items.
Full time employees get 60% off of full-priced items.
Part time employees get 40% off of full-priced items.","The pay for the workload is wildly unacceptable.
Educators (entry-level employees) are expected to pull the most weight for the team, with intense sales tactics, practices, and goals. It is aggressive, but not rewarding.
Most educators start at $12-$13/hr in Arkansas, and they are solely responsible for the financial success of the company.

As a Key Leader, you make a couple dollars more hourly than the educators you are leading, which honestly feels wrong, as they are the ones busting tail on the sales floor daily.
You are expected to take on all other assets of the business and fully ""own"" areas like community, social media, product/merchandise etc. For $15/hour, there is an extreme amount of behind-the-scenes work expected of Key Leaders.

Assistant Managers and Store Managers do not actually care about your well being or the fact that you are only guaranteed 25 hours weekly as a ""full time"" employee. Everyone Key Leader and below who works at this store has a second job, just so they can break even on bills. 
The bonus structure for Key Leaders and Educators is based on how well the store financially performs compared to the goals set by lululemon for that store. 
The bonus structure for ASM's and SM's is based on how well they have ""managed"" the store, which basically boils down to making sure they don't give their employees too many hours (or honestly barely any hours at all). The ASM's and SM's almost always receive a large bonus each quarter, along with being guaranteed 40 hours of work each week. The Key Leaders and Educators get maybe 6 very small bonuses each year, if they are extremely lucky.

Don't even get me started on how this company has exploited people, practices, and cultures for its impressive capitalistic gain and success. 
lululemon is responsible for changing the face of yoga from something that was once free, and offered to all as a life practice for personal growth and healing, into a wealthy, white, American stereotype, all because of corporate greed."

2133,lululemon,Technology Departments = Toxic Culture,2021-01-02,2.0,Infrastructure Engineer,"This Vancouver-based retail clothing company has a lot going for it. There is still a lot of opportunity here for career development, training, and working with the latest technologies. The work-life balance is great, and there seems to be a lot of internal movement available if you wish to switch teams, roles, or otherwise go where you want. Employee benefit for lululemon clothing at a steep discount will get you some quality threads. Company did the right thing and continued paying store employees for a few months when all the stores were forced to close fully.","This company still has a ""startup"" mentality in the technology side of things. This means that unplanned work is king, and that little to no effort is spent on internal improvement work. In the project-based delivery environment, value is placed only on features and break-fix work. There is no recognition from leadership that technical process improvement work should take place at all. The culture in the technology teams is wildly divergent from the culture present in the rest of the business, to the detriment of the technology employees. There is a language gap, where the business fascination with choosing new words for established concepts creates a communication barrier. Meeting culture is rampant, and even the engineers not seeking any type of leadership role in the company can find themselves attending more than 25 hours of meetings in a 40-hour work week. DevOps is not treated as a management practice; Agile is given lip service with portfolio and project managers constantly seeking a ""hybrid waterfall"" approach to managing work. Management seem largely unaware of what kind of work each team does, and consistently recognize the wrong people. A core value of lululemon is ""Entrepreneurship"" yet any idea that is perceived to challenge the status quo is discouraged by middle management. Interactions with direct managers are encouraging, however communication with other levels of management are characterized by a distinct lack of understanding of the technologies and issues and even business logic at play. Purchases of tools are treated as a panacea to chronic issues, but there is no evidence that architects or directors have reviewed requirements and identified a tool that is fit-to-purpose. Reliance on professional services will frustrate engineers looking to develop a set of skills with new and interesting challenges. Management style leans heavily towards shifting blame, scapegoating is common, messaging inconsistent, and measure of success completely subjective, or based on subjective measurements like surveys. Though feedback is requested, it is not honoured, and contributes to a culture of fear. Double speak, revisionism, and ""weasel words"" are commonly employed by architects, directors, program managers, and others. Many systems administrators, unfamiliar with the shift to automation and code in the industry, seem to do less and less work, requiring contractors and newer full time employees to do the lion's share of the tasks required to complete a project. Micromanagement is common. Accountability is extremely low at all levels of the company. Performance reviews are once per year, and although they factor into the bonus schedule, the highest level of compensation is commonly held to be completely unattainable. There are few, if any, global standards, and indeed the implementation of standards that could reduce duplication of work are actively discouraged. It is a heavily siloed environment, with few people talking outside their immediate teams, and then only if they need something. There are multiple ticketing systems, multiple ways to receive work, multiple places to store documentation, multiple cloud provider solutions, multiple directories, multiple levels of approval for the simplest changes. Was surprised to begin looking for similar work in the industry and find that lululemon was not competitive in the market compared to offers from other companies. Raises were frozen during the 2020 pandemic, and Paid Time Off was reduced, yet despite the pandemic, profits and stocks soared, which made these measures incredibly self-serving."

Can be a fun environment.,"The wild expectations of our store teams to execute what is required with very little labor hours to spend is unacceptable. Roles and responsibilities of every job now that we were back in store post-closing due to covid are truly remarkable. The expectation that is put on the SM/ASM/KL bench is far beyond what we are getting paid. There is no relationship or collaboration between 'corporate' and the store teams, therefore, there is no knowledge of what the store teams need to execute on a day to day basis. From monitoring capacity, to maintaining physical distancing, cleaning checklists every 30 minutes, to scheduling constraints, and this is on top of doing our 'job' of selling great pants ; there needs to be better work to be done to limit the burnout from the GREAT employees that we have, and re-grounding in what the principles that lululemon stands for. People are NOT happy, they are tired, scared, and feel highly under supported. More/greater expectations with drastic pay cuts, which are to be understood, but something needs to be adjusted or changed.

lululemon has stepped away from what was once a beautiful, fun, supportive and empowering career, to feeling constantly beaten down, defeated, 'never good enough', and underpaid.

Forget having a day off. Emails, texts, and communication come through 7 days a week with sometimes less than a 24 hour turnaround to execute."

High deductible plan still costs a lot, requesting off is difficult because there is never anyone who isn’t working who can cover your shifts and vacation gets denied a lot. Vacation system is weird. You get paid 2 weeks vacation but it’s paid partially over all 52 weeks so when you take a week vacation you are now out a weeks pay. Although you got an extra $20 a week in each paycheck.... 2 weeks are paid and 3 are allowed to be taken your first few years .

- Staff Christmas Party. Fancy. Bougee. Great. 
- Can wear shorts to work. Comfort for 8 hours shifts. Makes a load of a difference when dealing with customers.","- Heavy favoritism, you'll get passed up on tons of positions within the GEC. Got passed up for a Floor lead position (basically managing the floor) I applied for (1 year at the job at the time). They gave the position to a new person 2 weeks into the job because this person became friends with the trainers. How do you manage 100 or so GEC educators when you just started the job 2 weeks ago? It's like asking someone to fly a plane 1 day into training. You're going to crash and burn. Prime example of how things are done at the GEC.
- Extremely high turnover. Get used to that elevator ding because that's the sound of new people going in and out of this job. They should have had their office on the ground floor so they can add a revolving door instead of that elevator. Hard to get used to your team when people are coming in and out."

The scheduling was never consistent and certain privileges would be afforded to others. For instance, some part-time educators were given the privilege to only work once a week to accommodate their jobs and schooling while others were required to work more than once a week despite having the same level of responsibility and obligations outside of the store. However, they'll only do this if they don't like you. My store happened to have a high turnover since the expectations were too high for people that just wanted to work part-time and have flexible scheduling. 

Getting time off was extremely difficult and our manager would implement a ""blackout"" period during certain times of the year outside of holiday if there were too many people requesting time off or vacation even if it was unpaid. 

While I loved the team sweats and workout classes, I felt like if you didn't go to workout classes during the day (9-5) when everyone else did, then you were a bit ostracized from the rest of the team and it would be harder to make connections with them. Because I had a full-time job and school outside of the store, I felt like a lot of my co-workers judged me for not wanting to spend time and ""connect."" Well, I am going to bluntly say that working out from 9-5PM on a weekday is not a reality for the majority of people who actually need to work or have career ambitions. 

Overall, the culture can be toxic and cult-like if you don't have the time or financial resources to participate in their community sweats or other parties/events. I felt like this job would have been perfect for someone who just wants to work for fun or doesn't have other obligations like a rich person."

Community involvement- depending on the store and manager paid time to workout and mingle in the fitness community and often discounted prices for classes at fitness studios. Good way to get your foot in the door to the fitness world. 

Discount on product for men in your life and sometimes a fun work environment and personal development opportunities 

Maternity leave plan after 2 years or longer in role is paid for time off on top of FMLA","It’s retail. Some managers and employees treat the job like they are changing the world and run it like a 9-5 career. When they are selling pricy workout wear. It’s no different than any other retailer. The culture can be a little eye roll ridiculous at times. Border line cult like. 

Young employee base can be immature and click like. Playing games and such at staff meetings feels more like middle school camp. Going out together and non required but highly encouraged team events. 

Managers in their 20s/low 30s don’t have life and career experience to understand what “work life balance” is and make it a challenge for employees to work around kids and family and 2nd job schedules. 

Current policy requires Very little grace and understanding in schedule requests of employees by managers and vacation policy is ridiculous unpredictable 

Managerial level rolls could be more flexible for remote work for administration work and work from home for administrative duties and less floor shifts.  

No paid sick time of sick time off. Must work when sick or get written up.  Same with grace period on running late or when unplanned issues occur - sick kid, flat tire, traffic. 

If you drop down from a manager or like rolls to educator they greatly reduce your pay despite time in roll. Same when moving from a higher pay class area (California) to somewhere with lower cost of living. 

Educator (regular employee) bonus structure and pay is border line poverty and most employees have second jobs or bank rolled by someone else. It is not a living wage. 

Long shifts for the sake of long shifts."

Integrated paid sick days
Nice training for feedback-based improvement for those newer to the workforce
Allows for great customer-worker interactions
Good discounts on products that are marked down
Ability to extend your discount for men's product (limited per month)","Cult-like work environment (you really have to buy into ""lululemon culture""... they basically have their own language
Never straightforward with their feedback. Constantly beating around the bush by using fluff like ""success meetings"" (which means you're not doing so hot"" or ""leadership logs"" (which is documentation of all the things you do wrong).
Managers do nothing most of the time. They stand around and talk to each other when on the floor like they're forbidden from helping guests. Then when bad reviews are left about ""workers talking to each other instead of helping"", they blame the educators as if that's not all they do, because customers can't tell the difference between a manager and an educator.
Moving up in the company has nothing to do with work ethic and skill. To move up you need to be friends with the managers and go on ""sweat dates' (workouts) with them as often as possible
Not flexible for students. Very strict availability requirements even for part-time employees.
Very difficult to get vacation time because the managers always insist it will be too busy that week to have people go on vacation
Blackout periods from Thanksgiving until mid-January.
Bonuses are extremely variable. So much so that the goals seem arbitrary.
Long, required monthly meetings where 90% of the time is wasted on ice breakers , why the managers appreciate each other, and a game, after which the remaining 10% will be ""training"" which is just a repeat of the same training as every month."

You are always staying busy and no day is rarely the same.

Does not feel like retail, which is refreshing.","Overall the culture is starting to decline - the company is doing great on paper and thus in the stock market because they are sucking every last minute out of their staff in the stores without compensating them extra (and in fact, making it more difficult to bonus). I left a professional company that had done this and unfortunately thought lululemon was different..

Impossible to get all of you work done in a 40 hour work week, but discouraged to work overtime.

If you work at a high volume store or a store that is open from 11a-6p and very low volume, your pay and responsibilities are all the same. If you’re considering a position you should attempt to get into a low-volume store for lower stress level and a better trade off when it comes to work-life balance.

Opportunities for moving up are very limited and very dependent on who you know, and sometimes that even doesn’t help. In fact, at times It’s difficult to respect those who you are calling/contacting higher on the ladder because they are so disconnected to what happens at the store level, even with the most basic details like what we need to run our bare-bones business."

2870,lululemon,Good experience minor issues,2019-11-20,4.0,Seasonal Sales Associate,"I had an absolute blast working at Lululemon. I loved the team and everything that the company stood for. I will admit, when yo are working at an expensive clothing store you get sucked into toxic company culture. This could be buying really expensive items or really pushing for a sale. I did like that in the beginning of each shift we had a ""clearing"" where we talked about anything that was stopping us from performing our best or concerns, to focus on and doing the best at your job. The discount was good, I believe 25-30% off regular items and 70-75% off of sale, so you were definitely rocking those aligns. 

A common misconception people have about working seasonal is holiday. It's almost inevitable that sh*t is going to get crazy. But if you have a good team and a cup of Starbucks, its manageable. You meet your best and worst guests during that time. As I said, it depends on the person and company. I enjoyed my stay because my beliefs aligned with the company and we had a good team.","If your able to channel your ""inner white girl"" your fine. You'll be mentioning those three F's about products and can tell the difference between aligns and wonder unders.

The discount and the workout stipend are a great perk as well.","Once people surpass the role of Key Leader into Assistant Store Manager and beyond, they act as though the rules don't apply to them. Sure, they are now salaried and Store Managers have paid vacation so their rule book is technically different, but it's incredibly frustrating to be one of the employees driving sales on the floor watching your manager take dozens of vacations and sit in his office with the door closed while the grunt work (especially during the holidays) can often be brutal. If the manager isn't around to witness what's good and bad on the floor, there's no way you can actually respect their advice for how to increase sales, improve guest experience, etc. when holding reviews. I can't say this attitude is the same for all managers but I've encountered a handful who play this game. There is a fine line between earning the perks you have received and not forgetting where you came from and it seems pretty common for them to cross it and never look back.

This is standard for retail but the job growth is basically non-existent. If you start as an educator you have a chance of being a Key Leader if you work your butt off, but ASM and SM roles come around once in a blue moon. The part that is different at lululemon is that they act as if exciting career opportunities are abundant and all you have to do is ask and ""get curious"" about them, but the fact is unless you're willing to move to Vancouver to work on the Operations side of the house, you'll be an educator forever."

Lululemon truly changed my life and I struggled really hard when I left the place to move on to a full time (hired not temp) position. The workouts and the trainers and the staff are so friendly and they really try to do things for the employees like luncheons, or having breakfast there at the start of the shift.","No set schedule. They may tell you that you will work X to X, but there is SO much mandatory overtime. Not good for a family. Also, the turnover rate is the worst thing. I was told so many times that I was on the chopping block because I wasn't running fast enough when I would be sent to another department to train which leads me to my next con. I have zero problem with cross training, but you can't expect somebody to master another department within a few hours. I certainly feel like there is a little bit of discrimination against heavier people who cannot move as fast as somebody fit. I was certainly turning my lift around working there, but sometimes they really made me feel down with they would say I was on the ""chopping block for not moving fast enough"". Also was there more than 90 days without missing or being late once and no offer for full time. Many employees had been there for 8+ months with no offer of full time"

I came from a really toxic corporate culture with my previous employer, and found a healthy workplace at lululemon, a culture that really supported my personal & professional growth, and a community of really rad humans. lululemon attracts quality people to their organization, and almost everyone I had the chance to work with was genuine, caring and a hard working team player.

the benefits are incredible. lululemon really walks the talk - they practice what they preach when it comes to health and wellness. 

the company gives a sh*t about you as a person. I have received so much personal development coaching throughout the years, it's mind-blowing. So I'm leaving this company not only with more work experience, but a better person because of the tools it has given me to work on myself.","lululemon likes to do A LOT. Too much, in my opinion. And sometimes it feels like teams are always rushing from one project/campaign to the next, with quick deadlines, and there isn't enough space for celebrations and learnings. it keeps work interesting for sure, but can be dizzying sometimes. 

Although there is a great culture of feedback and folks are used to sharing constructive criticism all the time (which is awesome) - there can be a bit of a herd mentality on certain teams that makes it hard to share negative observations. There's a lot of lingo at lululemon and at times the way it is used by management doesn't facilitate tough conversation/collaboration, it discourages it.

Finally, more remote positions would be great. At the moment, growing with the company outside of store management is almost impossible if you aren't willing to move to Vancouver."

They don't know how to care for their employees or support them in their growth. There tends to be a lot of favoritism throughout stores. Also if you aren't an active participant in the hottest workout classes that the leadership team in your store is obsessing over then you are somewhat ostracized.

Opportunity to connect with community (studio owners/other athletes/inspiring people)

At the end of the day, the company is trying to create a good vibe and culture but ends up with unhappy employees (in my case anyway)","after 6 months it became stressful. There is a lot of pressure to workout at certain places that can be a 40 minute drive away from your house and you’re unpaid for that time, so that is a big investment in time and money especially if you’re a student. There seems to be a lack of consideration if you have a personal life and want work life balance-there is an expectation that you attend community events unpaid. A lot of pressure to help meet stores $ daily goals. It is fun to have workouts paid for to attend with work colleges but they aren’t really free at the end of the day-there are things expected of you (unpaid time at events ect). If you want a job where you can leave and come home and forget about it until your next shift and it’s only a portion of your life-not for you.

 If you want a stressful job, pressure to be places on your day off 40 mins drive away non paid, it’s for you. Also promises that you can move up in the company and be involved in more when you never do. 

I felt like I couldn’t say ‘no’, without being ‘punished’ in Some way (hours lost or possibility of moving up gone) all because I didn’t want to spend my day off working. 

There is so much talk about the comanies values however not much room for a stress free life whilst working there. Always made to feel like your efforts weren’t good enough even though you had loyal customers that loved you. 

Toward the end of my employment so many of my colleagues were unhappy at work but felt like they couldn’t tell management."

For managers, there is a lot of runway given to manage how we'd like, and at the same time loads of support by way of internal offerings and external resource access. 

With a focus on personal development and goal-crushing, the company legitimately looks at employees individually, and helps provide tools needed for development however that employee sees fit; even if that means the employee leaves to go on to new and better things! This is the first I've seen a company actively help their employees be entrepreneurs, and it makes for an excellent experience.","It's a public corporation, with the accompanying responsibilities to shareholders.

Pay attention to the negative ones and what they're talking about, there's a common theme: they don't practice what they preach. There's a culture problem in virtually every department, and the ones that deny it are either too oblivious or part of the problem. 

Egos are GIGANTIC in this company, I had to sit through countless meetings of people just going on and on about their ""vision"" while everyone is just actually hearing some self ego-stroking. Some of the feedback you'll get from your work will be simply because the ""senior"" member of the team simply ""doesn't like it"". No other reason, none. It's literally their personal opinion and you gotta change it/redo your work. And this is not just in one department: it's in ALL of them!

You wanna know how people really feel when they work there? Take them away from the company, even in the shuttle you will hear people vent their frustrations frequently.

- Higher than average pay part-time retail
- Some awesome people","Following the honeymoon period, one finds themselves to be in a mentally and emotionally draining work environment surrounded by mostly awesome educators and then there are  KLs (some), ASMs, SMs, and above...

The more time you spend here, the more mentally draining, toxic, and bizarre the days become. Eventually, I've found working here to be comparable to being in an abusive relationship. Look up ""gaslighting"" and that is exactly what one encounters here. You will literally begin to think you must be crazy and have self-doubt, before coming back to grips with reality upon leaving the store. Integrity, entrepreneurship, and growth are all touted as being key to company culture and yet, the exact opposite is what you will find. 

Feedback culture can quickly turn passive aggressive, tiresome, and petty.

Company policies, expectations, and rules matter, except when and for whom they don't... 

Overall, you get to work with a lot of great people, but also a lot of not so great people and unfortunately, the culture facilitates practices that are unprofessional and of poor business acumen .

Overall, Lulu is a great company to work for, especially for those interested in working their way up in retail!","Management at my particular store was pretty atrocious. While Lululemon preaches the value of integrity and frowns upon gossip, the management at the store I worked at lacked integrity and supported gossip as it’s main means of managing.

They also have a bias against paying internal employees competitive salaries compared to the industry and would rather keep you on the low end as much as possible. This is often an issue for recruitment and retention. If top tier salaries is your priority, this isn't the right place to go.

My colleagues were smart, motivated, and curious; there was a real sense of entrepreneurship with what we were able to create for our store. I signed on as a part-time educator with plans to leave after six months, and ended up holding every store position: Educator, Key leader, Assistant Store Manager, Store Manager.

Great benefits for retail positions: affordable health care, 401K, stock options and a stipend for working out.","Hierarchical -- if you start in the store and want to move up with the company, you will need to move through every single retail position even if you have goals outside of retail.

Unprofessional practices, at times, that create awkward environments: ""clearings"" where employees share very personal things that are holding them back from being present, ""educator breakfasts"" where managers ask employees to give feedback about other managers -- this often turns into unprofessional smack-talking, and causes ill-will in the store that didn't exist before.

The training didn't include anything about selling until the third and fourth day of training. The first two days were all about developing yourself and your interests. 

Working there allows you to be fun, energetic, and build relationships with your peers and guests that come in the store. 

There are many perks to working at lululemon that I probably won't speak about due to privacy I'm assuming, but it is worth it.","Recently, they implemented a way of management that ultimately led me to leaving. It is fairly new so I'm sure it will be resolved - they are constantly pushing you to bother guests and ask them if they need help (like the first 5 people who asked them was not enough).

They can be a little excessive in how active they are in the community. It is great if people are into it, but if other educators (sales associates) aren't into it, that does not mean they do not belong there. 

Besides that, and slight favouritism, the company is great!

In fact, you cannot say anything remotely deemed as negative. Certain people get away with certain things that others do not and it's very disheartening. For a company that claims to be about ""peace and love"" the way my store ran was cult-like and very much so like high school. I would hear management say AWFUL things about employees all on company time and consider it a ""development discussion"" when it was just gossiping.

Managers act as coaches: helping you focus on improving your work performance or just achieving your personal or health goals, too. The best part of the job is the sense of community with your coworkers and free yoga/workout classes every week at almost any studio or gym.","It's a retail environment and your hours and commission are dictated by how well your store achieves their financial goals. If you are not working at a very busy store, your take home will suffer in the slow months and your hours will likely be cutback. Although the company and managers are eager to develop people to move up the pipeline, you must be patient as there may not always be a position open without forcing you to travel or relocate. I witnessed many people ""stuck"" as a part-time or full time worker waiting for a manager position to open up...months and years. Sometimes you are led on to believe you are being considered and developed for a manager position, only to learn that you ""just aren't ready yet"" without any tangible reasons. Just like any other job, if you get along with management, you're more likely to be recommended for opportunities. Managers continuously voice the importance of work/life balance, however there will be many store events, workouts, goal sessions, etc. that will happen outside of your shifts that you aren't paid for. Of course, you are always able to not attend but if you are looking for a promotion, it's expected that you are at every event."

You have to do so much free work. And yes, it's my choice, however, is it? Because I feel like if the choice I made was to not volunteer my time it was frowned upon and I wasn't a team player.

You're basically going to make only $15 an hour if you're an ""educator"" because the daily goals are drastically high and nearly unattainable. You will work your booty off to make those goals, only to have like half of your commission taking away in taxes. For how much energy you put into selling those stretchy pants, you could be making much more $$$ in any other job involving sales. If you have the tenacity to make awesome sales, then you are wasting your potential at this store.

There is no employee parking. You either have to pay $17 a day, (yes, $17!), to park in the structure, or park over a mile away near Montana Ave to park there for free. Most of the street parking is permit only, so you have to park really far.

Getting full-time status is nearly impossible. Even if you work full-time hours, you won't get full-time status, unless management gives you the title. You have to jump through hopes to be full-time.

Male employees are treated better than female employees.

It starts to feel like a sorority. If you're in college and this is just a summer job, maybe you'll like this, but when people, (men, too), in their mid-20s start acting like catty sorority girls, then there's a problem.

The free workout classes were the biggest pro, but now that money is taxed heavily in our paychecks, so it's hardly a pro anymore, and it's not really ""free"" at that point.

I very much enjoyed working there, though I was only part time and I was also in grad school. It's a culture, and they want their employees to embody that culture and for the most part everyone does. Because of that, I found it easy to make friends and get along with my co-workers. Similar to any retail job, the work is not too challenging, but at ivivva it was actually fun and fast paced. The pay is great for retail as well.","The leadership was lacking, and there was almost an over-done aspect to the culture. Managers would go out of their way to follow what the company decided was best in a situation, regardless of their relationship with you. It felt impersonal at times. Further, higher education was not one of the components of the culture and I felt that being a full time student was not okay with a lot of the management and they were not flexible with my schedule or able to give me the hours that I needed."

There's heavy emphasis on keeping energy levels neck-high to deliver ""great guest experience"" but often at the cost of our own educator experience. Floor shifts can be fun with a competitive spirit but usually depends on who the floor lead is that day. As with most retail jobs, the learning curve is not good, I found myself bored after 6 months with limited opportunities to advance into non-store roles. My immediate manager had great ideas, but suffered from grave disorganization and lack of relevant experience in marketing, making my development journey one that was very ambiguous."

As well, if you were friends with management then you were favoured in place of others who did work incredibly hard. Found it hard to break into the group honestly. They were also very meticulous about everything in places that it didn't need to be, such as closing the store and putting every item of clothing away perfectly, only to get destroyed the next morning by customers.

Many complaints from team members that they don't like the culture, management, and the way things are run. Hiring decisions don't always make sense. The people in the store manager and regional manager roles aren't always the best fit, and it is very apparent that some are incompetent at their jobs. If you find a manager you like, stay at that location because a great store manager is hard to find.

-can be fun floor environment if you are personable, upbeat, and want to be hands-on","-constant coaching and feedback that can be taxing. No time when someone cannot tell you how you are ""occurring"" to them...
-lack of boundary between being on at work and off when you are away. You could get calls when you are supposed to be off, or asked to have it complete before you next come in even though you are supposed to be off and on personal time. Technically this is not supposed to happen according to the handbook, but in practice it is happening. It would be one thing if you were salaried and great benefits, but you aren't.
-inability to truly live off the income. No 401k. No paid maternity leave.
-constant talk about goals and taking action so you can live your best life, but you are underpaid and worked to the bone so having the money, energy and time to be loving your life is unrealistic. When such concerns are raised you are given feedback for being and ""choosing"" negativity, and not ""choosing happiness"". Maybe you are even giving a formal feedback for improvement (basically a formal warning) that clearly states at end that you may be terminated if this occurs again. You CAN receive this type of formal warning for things such as being out of choice, out of collaboration, and a plethora of other intangibles....
-Total lack of separation between work responsibilities and your personal life. 
-Empty promises about future roles and opportunities. When something doesn't work out for an employee they are told that it is their ""choice"" to keep going or whatever. Sometimes upper management really does just EFF up and there is a negative impact on peoples careers, but there is NO acknowledgment of this. It just turns into a coaching session about what you are choosing...
-You will struggle if this is your main source of income and you are in urban area. Will either need parental support, boyfriend, husband, major savings, trust fund, or 2 other jobs.
-If you are interested in and looking to work at lululemon... go for it... you will meet nice people and learn about sales and retail business basics, but keep your head level and your options open. There are lots of good jobs and careers out there that pay and support you better (i.e. training, vacation pay, maternity leave, lifework balance, schedule etc...)"

It's true guys, before I came to this company I read the reviews and didn't believe it would happen to me but it did and not to my advantage. I was a threat to my mgrs due to my knowledge and talent so they coached me out. SCC ( corp) is full of katty bees too. They fill entitled to tear you down if you're good at what you do. People potential (h.r) is a mystery, they make themselves hidden. Also, they tend to hire people w/o retail experience and it's frustrating if you do have the knowledge b/c you carry the weight of the store and when you try to give feedback about safety and shrink issues you become a threat. As much as this company preaches that they like feedback, they don't, it's 1 way street. Mgrs use feedback and values as weapons. Also, ivivva is new. They are experiencing lots of growing pains, mostly in sales and inventory. They are missing a lot of structure. It's very frustrating to deal with. Oh, and it's sooooooo boring to work there. And the time they expect you to work off the clock, use your personal email, personal phone ( work text messaging) is so not a work life balance they preach. Vacation is paid out on every pay check so you don't really find yourself taking a vacation. And they expect hard working go getters but because of the lack of benefits ( medical, vacation pay, 401k) and low wages a single person pushing their career can't afford to live.

The people you work with are 95% positive, happy and friendly.  I feel like my office is my home away from home and feel forturnate to be surrounded by so many terrific people.  I feel like we all work as a team and there's alot of support all around.","Working from home is frowned upon and won't accomodate a 4 day work week.

If you are willing to work on a cult-like atmosphere then you'll fit in just fine. There are some incredible people you'll work with, but they are few and far between.
The discount is killer especially if your working full time which many are not given the opportunity to do so. For example: full time employee get 60% off regular priced items and 75% off mark-down items. 
You also get reimbursement for your favorite place to sweat which is pretty cool. Once again, it's better to be a full time employee; $200 reimbursement versus part-time employees who only get $100.","Be prepared to work every single weekend! They claim work life balance but this is NOT the case. If you want to take time off be prepared to feel guilty. It's all about ""team"", until it benefits or does not benefit the management team, then it's all about them. 
The atmosphere is definitely cult-like. If you do not fit in at the beginning it can be difficult to find your footing with in the team. Being a favorite of the management team will get you far!"

But that's relative to where you live and how you spend your money. Part-time and full-time employees must work at least one weekend each week. Since it's retail, you'll find half your colleagues in transition and half working full-time and some working towards vertical advancement within the company.

They truly care about where you are going and where you want to be, even if it isn't a permanent future with Lululemon. 

One of my favorite things is the ""illegal"" backroom conversations. Talking about a team member behind their back is not allowed. I was hesitant to work for a store that was 90% female coworkers because I don't like the caddy-ness that happens when girls spend too much time together. However, at Lululemon, you are held accountable for giving, what we call, Feedback, whether it is positive or constructive. It helps to know that you have the ability to give your peers feedback, but the greatest thing is that you have the ability, and are encouraged, to give feedback to your managers and leadership team. It is an empowering company to work for without a doubt.","The blackout period from December 15-January 15 for holiday shopping.

Perks: company pays for employees to work out pretty much anywhere in the community, the discount on merchandise is very generous, and the commission system allows for employees to make a great deal more than base pay when the store does well.  Opportunity for growth if you are willing to dedicate a lot of time to it.","Company puts big emphasis on work-life balance, but sometimes doesn't live up to that.  Projects are often expected to be done when there isn't time during shifts to do them, so I end up doing them on my own time.  Additionally, requesting time off can be a pain, as my store made us use a vacation day if any change in availability on the weekend was made.  Lastly, the company only offers a job-protected maternity leave if you worked a certain number of hours within 12 months before leave.  Despite having worked full-time for the company for the better part of 4 years, I was not guaranteed my job back because I was finishing my degree while working part-time for several of the months during my pregnancy, so I had to resign and then apply back after my leave."

Meanwhile, dominating, hypocritical, and superficial employees were promoted quickly. Also, the opportunity for growth with the company was grossly misrepresented. All of the above was an unfortunate discovery for those who signed on because they they thought it would be a yogic environment filled with opportunity; especially given that most of the people I knew there had taken HUGE pay cuts to be there.

4495,lululemon,"worthwhile, however choose your path wisely",2014-05-31,3.0,Keyleader,Some of the people at this company are absolutely fantastic individuals and remain some of my closest friends. The focus that is given during your first 6 months here can really help build a strong sense of self and realization of one's goals in life way beyond your time at the company. Especially for the younger staff I worked with the reward of watching their personal growth happen in a relatively short period of time was my most fulfilling memory of my employment here.  Meeting and working out with some of the best instructors in my city was also a highlight and the health care package includes complimentary workouts at any studio. I highly advise anyone who thinks they are interested in the company to work for a contract seasonal position to see if it's a good fit.,"The culture is appealing for sure, however over time it can become exhausting, diminished and hypocritical.  Being a member of management made longevity here really taxing as you were expected to give 150% of yourself, your time and energy as a base line to be considered a ""good employee"". The concept of ""worklife balance"" is spoken of but too often forgotten about. Upper management is very disconnected from what happens at a store level. Don't expect to have much privacy about your life here, you wanting to keep anything private is considered holding you back from your own development. Vacation time or days off are difficult and I found that the only way to have control over my life balance was to have a group of employees that had each other's backs and would barter coverage when needed (I got you if you get me this day). Compensation is hourly with enhancement of team commission for most positions, how well you do depends mostly on the success of the store location and  organization of management. At times you will be pressured into incorporating many workouts at many locations all over your city and that at times can be very stressful and tiring. The quality of the product at times was in question and as a team we were told to keep it under wraps- that rode on my conscious and made me question the moral fiber of the company as a whole."

4499,lululemon,Good experience,2014-05-24,3.0,Educator,"Based on how the store does, you earn a daily & monthly bonus -- it's a team bonus so it takes out the cut-throat mentality of most sales positions. They pay for your workouts, provide you with life-goal coaching. If you want to see change within the company, it's pretty easy to get ahold of who you need to talk to up at corporate , but seeing changes made from your feedback is a completely different story (might not ever happen). We do talk with the designers once a month to give them guest product feedback, but who knows it if they actually listen.","I know some people that are Educators for 2+ years PART TIME and are never offered fulltime status, even if they have been promised it by management. Product quality has really gone down the toilet over the past year or so , so it's hard to stand by a brand that isn't 100% transparent. If you have any plans of working for corporate, your best bet is to go somewhere else to get experience (especially if it's specialized) and then come back and apply for jobs at corporate. It's next to impossible to start as an Educator and move up to corporate without having to put up with years of BS and become a Key Leader, ASM, and SM first. Very frustrating."

I have 2 higher degrees (BA and MA) in a field that would allow me to move up in any apparel company, and it was my dream to work in HQ at lulu. But for some reason I wasn't able. I financed a trip myself to canada and visited/shadowed the team I wanted to eventually be on, networked, sent emails, communicated with my store manager, applied to the position I wanted, etc. I was part time at lulu & had a 2nd job relevant to my eventual dream job, but always expressed a desire to become full time at lulu on the store level in an effort to eventually move up to my dream job there. After a year and a half in this situation, I couldn't even even achieve full time status in the store; in fact, there were newer employees than I that were given full time status before me. I GAVE UP and now work in HQ at a different apparel company. Looking back, it's hard to fight the feeling that I wasted a year and a half working there for nothing..."

There's no accountability in terms of what the key leaders or assistant managers might be doing that you have a problem with (very ""who watches the watchmen"" sort of deal). Like many have said here, most - if not all - of your managers are in their mid-20s and it shows. They tout work-life balance as something that they strive for, but honestly, if you're not showing your face and making your presence known/chumming it with upper management, you will be cast aside. Many people felt that hours were given based on preferential treatment, and not on actual needs as displayed by the employees. Compensation, though higher than the average rate, was still very little, and with such volatility in how many hours you might be receiving, it was often stressful not knowing how much income you might actually be receiving. Furthermore, they expected you to often come much earlier than your shift, which is understandable; however, receiving negative ""feedback"" for arriving not early enough by their standards was difficult to comprehend, especially when many people could not sustain a living simply by working at Lululemon, and required other forms of employment to maintain an adequate standard of living. 
Power plays were definitely a thing here, and that might come from the fact that management was just a couple years older than the average educator. This became especially apparent when after working under various managers; because no one was in charge of the managers, often working under one of their shifts meant that you would do things their way, which often undermined the work of another manager. But it didn't matter, because there was no one there to hold them accountable for their actions. Innovation, like the work-life balance, was constantly encouraged, so long as you didn't annoy anyone in management. Finally, as many other have said here, management constantly doled out what they termed ""feedback"", which more often than not felt like a way for them to undermine your work and/or paint you as a bad employee. If there was something that they didn't particularly like that you did, they would make sure to make a note of it so that other managers could see your ""shortcomings"". In the end, there was not much wiggle room for the creativity that they talked about so freely; it was often best to put your head down, make few suggestions, and do the task at hand (or, if the store was empty and there was nothing to do, pretend that you were doing something).
This is all unfortunate, because although I did enjoy my time there as a whole, it became very apparent that unless I wasn't completely willing to bow down to the culture and drink the Lulu Kool-Aid, then I would forever be considered an outsider."

Depending on your store there can be major drama.  Other things include super clickiness or even personality differences can be an issue of wether or not you can move up to your next role.  If they like you, then you can move up.  Also they document every little thing about you in this book and watch for patterns they want to fix about you.

I was older than most of the other educators AND management, and I was mid twenties, and wow was that made clear! I also have children and was a single mother at the time, going to classes outside of work was pretty close to impossible, and I was constantly being questioned about my lack of commitment. I also didn't feel the 'cheerleader' mold, but in no way am i unfriendly or unapproachable, and found it hard to maintain the constant fake smile I was encouraged to withhold. My manager took it upon herself to hire personal friends and make them key leaders with no experience, over many of us who had worked there for over a year. Management and keyleaders were usually found sitting in our back room or outside of the store gossiping. I was eventually accused of having a bad attitude (which was the same laid back and quiet ('bad') attitude i had for 2 years of employment there. I was written up for a completely vague reason which i never understood. The manager lied to my face when i arranged a meeting with her, telling me she had no idea about my write up or the reason behind it. I was fired days later, with her signature on the paperwork. Lucky me, i was then the unemployed single mother who desperately needed to keep that job, exasperated because i was essentially fired by a clique straight out of Mean Girls.

The benefits were amazing and would benefit anyone who is athletic hence why you have to be athletic to be hired. The interview process was different than others that I have experienced but thorough, they really want to make sure you fit the mold. It was pretty easy to get shifts covered if need be, there were okay modes of communication to make sure that this could get done. Self-development was always encouraged, whether it was reading a book from the knowledge library on leadership or getting experience working in the much busier lululemon.","You have to REALLY be passionate about this job, otherwise spending 8 hours on a slow day with only 3 guests in might be enough to hand in resignation. While it is fun to work on fast-moving days, there are often months of really slow ones and they can be long and tedious. Because lululemon is always hiring, sometimes the location will hire too many people and there will be not enough hours to support everybody therefore somebody gets the boot! The expectation to be bubbly and happy is constantly first and foremost, and you could get a talking-to just for not smiling for a split-second. The other employees at the store sometimes took their job a bit too seriously and fixated on issues and problems that really were not that bad. However, it probably is what keeps them going considering most of the people there plan on making their whole life about working at lululemon."

They expect you to show up early and work late without being compensated. They berate you and belittle you under the guise of ""feedback,"" which is basically an umbrella term to deguise harrassment. The Landmark Forum was mandatory. My manager at the time wouldn't even promote me because I told her that I wouldn't take the forum. I told her that it made me feel uncomfortable, and she told me that I wasn't ""committed"" to the job. She also told me that having private thoughts that I didn't voice outloud were considered to be ""gossip"" and against company policy. 

I tried taking my concerns to the next up in command, but I was rebuffed completely. She told me that I shouldn't be talking to her about it, and to deal with my problems on my own. 

I don't know what the CEO is doing, but he doesn't seem interested in improving company morale or reducing turnover, because it is extremely high. 

The people that last in the company are the people who surrender completely, mind, body and soul. They give up their free will and dedicate their entire lives, around the clock, to doing whatever they are told and don't ask for anything in return. This company will destroy you if you're not careful."

It all sounds very nice at the outset, but ""having a conversation"" is really just a code word for you are not performing well and logging each conversation seems like a strange way of management being able to keep track of everyone's business.
Very cliquey. Management will pick their favorites, and if you aren't one of them, you are going down fast.
Also, if you aren't absolutely ecstatic to have the privilege of working at Lululemon where only the best and brightest are chosen for such amazing positions as product educators, you are probably going to lose your job."

They make their clothes for tiny, athletic types.  Management has no problem slamming you for any reason they can think of.  I have heard this time and time again from people who have worked for this company.  If you get through the first interview, expect 2 additional interviews, and they are group interviews.  My 3rd interview they made us do rediculous tasks in public!  After 3 days, I was completely ripped by my boss several times for things that didn't even occur!  She refused to let me succeed.  I still can't figure out how after 3 interviews and numerous conversations with her and after she told me she & I just ""clicked"", why she decided after Day 3 on the job that she couldn't stand me.

-The company explains WHY they make particular decisions- you feel valued and included","The interview process is infuriating... I've interviewed so many times before and after I've gotten hired.

It DOES NOT MATTER AT ALL if you've worked for the company before and got a killer reference, they want someone who fits their *personal* image of  the ideal educator. 

Your goals are out for everyone to see-guests, co-workers, etc. Not alot of privacy in this company... and that goes against  the whole life-work ""balance"" the company preaches. 

You have to fit in this box of expected behavour- I am frequently told to smile more, to stand up straight, that I look better with my makeup/hair done

Heavy discount on the company's products","Lululemon is a company that is growing very fast but does not know how to handle the growth. There is very little leadership in the management team of Lululemon head office. Many managers focus more on proving themselves to their bosses than leading their teams. The company has become quite corporate. Some managers set themselves apart from employees because they have the manager title. Experts hired to do technical jobs aren’t respected for their expertise but are told how to do their job by managers who don’t have the required technical knowledge or skills. Culture has become “saying the cultural keywords” in conversations rather than actually living it. Sustainability is not being valued in many practices, from basic office materials and supplies through to product development and production. Departments work in silos and do not understand how one part can deeply impact the other parts, which has constant negative impact on workflow. The company cannot come up with a process to manage the workflow, but the management team is really slow in acknowledging and responding to that. Some senior managers have no clue how hard employees have to work to make things happen and keep product delivery on time. There is very little integrity in the management team in terms of keeping their word, working within the timeline, and acting as leaders that represent the company’s culture. However, the company fails to recognize the problem in the management team and is constantly losing skilled employees."

-They claim to be a luxury brand and company, yet  they are so nit-picky and monitor what sizes you are buying to make sure it's for you and not for a friend or family member-my friend that worked for Chanel in NYC got one day every 3 months to buy things for family and friends-that's a luxury company-sorry lululemon
-once you give your two weeks notice you are not allowed your discount even though you are still an employee of the company-once again tacky
-if you don't fit a particular mold they are looking for they dismiss any sort of feedback you give them. if you are the type to speak up and point out flaws in the management don't work here... they say they appreciate feedback, but really they appreciate the feedback that they want to hear. Our store was the last privately owned lululemon in the nation and corporate took over in September. All employees were completely open to this change and saw it as a great opportunity....Everything went down hill fast.. People got screwed over immensely by corporate employees and within the past 2 months 5 employees have left- two of which had been loyal employees for 4+ years.

- expect a lot of hypocrisy- the company claims to have core values of honesty, integrity, feedback..etc... they expect you to have those but not management. They pick and choose which ones they want to follow in a given situation

-Be expected to work under people that are ignorant and on power trips if they are in a leadership position above you. If you are smart and ambitious and are not a push-over this place is not for you. 

Take my advice and don't work here. It causes too much unwanted stress in your life, because of the amount of crap you have to put up with (or don't have to put up with since my last day is Saturday). If you want to work retail work some where else. This company tries to hide the fact that it's terrible by being in your face about personal development and goal coaching, when really they want to mold you into what THEY want you to be..

They have lots of activities for employees - a wide variety and all are fun.
Co-workers are mostly interesting and easy to get along with.
Health is promoted - nutrition and exercise and mental.
Lots of locations so can move around to try something new.
The company is huge now compared to when I was there - so I am sure that there is opportunity everywhere.
I have seen some of my ex-coworkers driving new BMW's and Audi's.  So there is money to made.
Amazing staff discounts.
Shared commission system so not competitive like other retail companies.  Creates a much better work environment.","It feels like they have a carrot constantly dangling in front of you promising you wonderful things but I also felt disappointed by my lack of movement in the company.

Eventually, almost my entire work days and days off became booked with company activities.  Whether, on floor working, meetings, sports events, dinner out, supporting co-workers, covering shifts - it got to the point where I would book my weekends out of town so that I could say 'No'.  It felt like, they expected you to give everything to them.  This is where it felt a bit like a cult.  Everything is wonderful and everybody is happy and we all love each other.  But in the end I had little extra time for friends and activities outside the company.  

I have an impression that the company knows that women in the work place can be more inspired   by passion than money.  So it feels like the company will treat the job like it is the most amazing thing ever and people will work for lower financial compensation than its market value.  

I know someone who hosted a Lululemon clothing sale in their yoga studio in a suburb where their is no Lululemon.  The employees brought racks and racks of clothes in.  They sold thousands and thousands of dollars of product.- maybe, $20,000.  They offered no financial compensation for my friend.  I believe 5-10% of sales would be a normal incentive/Thank you for hosting something of this magnitude.  My friend bought finger foods, bought flowers to create atmosphere, paid a couple of her teachers to help out, cleaned before and after.  She is a new business owner and money is extremely tight.  Lululemon is a huge multi billion dollar company and they offered her no financial compensation for her time, the 
use of her studio space, or for money she invested into the event.

I feel that this company is very good at taking advantage.  So be aware.  Keep your eyes open.  Don't let them suck you dry."
